A lot has happened. On the personal side, things are not going well. The bootcamp has really taken its toll on family-related things. Its affected my outlook on life. Lambda is a double-edged sword. It offers a fantastic opportunity, and I&#8217;m grateful for it, but the other side is that its a significant commitment to go through it and keep up. The skills and network that students build are wonderful, but, for me at least, work/life balance is absolutely destroyed. I&#8217;m getting close to the end of it though. I&#8217;m in the computer science section, so front-end and back-end are behind me, and I really do have the ability to build websites and even simple CRUD applications now, both front-end and back-end. I need to reference my notes, and they&#8217;re probably not optimized or especially secure yet, but that will come with more learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a more positive front, I&#8217;m learning <strong>Python</strong>, tackling code challenges &#8211; something which really unnerved me in the past &#8211; and have been going through <strong><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/\">freeCodeCamp</a></strong>&#8216;s material as a way to clear my head a little from the harder topics at Lambda for the past few weeks. Last night, I completed fCC&#8217;s <strong>Responsive Web Design</strong> course and earned my first certificate! I&#8217;m deciding between JavaScript and Python next. I&#8217;ll probably end up going with Python, because its more in-line with what we&#8217;re using right now at Lambda, so my hope is that it&#8217;ll couple well and reinforce what I&#8217;m currently tackling.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1007\" height=\"599\" data-attachment-id=\"1902\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/fcc-responsive-web-design/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1007,599\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fcc-responsive-web-design\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=1007\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=1007\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1902\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg 1007w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/fcc-responsive-web-design.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1007px) 100vw, 1007px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Going headfirst into Python taught me something. So many of the tech-people I follow online have said to learn programming concepts, and not necessarily to focus on the syntax of a language. Concepts carry over and languages are just tools to implement a solution. Diving into Python has shown me that I do actually have the ability to learn other languages, maybe even rapidly as far as basics go. Knowing a bit of JavaScript has given me a reference point to compare with Python. I can see how loops or branching statements work in one, as compared to the other. I can see what data structures are supported, and how traversing them differs. It does help with confidence and with combating impostor syndrome, which is rampant in tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lambda went through some big structural changes recently. My cohort felt a brunt of the changes. We didn&#8217;t have team leads or section leads anymore. We&#8217;re all mentors to people behind us in the program (I like my mentee a lot, he&#8217;s a former social worker and my working with clinicians helps me to understand him &#8211; I gave him a project idea that I&#8217;m hoping he works on). Now, we do have some team leads who are available to offer support hours again, but the first few weeks were rough. Our instructor, <strong>Glenna Yu</strong>, went through the changes with us and has weathered them really well. She&#8217;s fantastic. She&#8217;s really sharp and helps us to nail down algorithms for code challenges every time we have a lecture. She often shows us multiple approaches to a given problem. She&#8217;s one of the two best instructors I&#8217;ve had at Lambda so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wife&#8217;s cousin is recently out-of-work due to COVID. He and I Zoomed for a bit last week, because he&#8217;s exploring options and programming is one of them. I went over some of what we learned at Lambda with him, and showed him free resources to start. I know that he only got to start reviewing them a few days ago and is about 60% through with the first lesson in the Responsive Web Design course at freeCodeCamp (the HTML/CSS one). It could be fun if he takes to it. He&#8217;s a problem-solver.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m considering blogging recent Lambda topics and then backtracking in the future, to finish the React and Node stuff that I never got to write up. I hate going out-of-order, but there&#8217;s so much to write, and I&#8217;m really just adding to the pile by not tackling at least some of it whenever I can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. I hope all of you are doing well and are learning and advancing and building things. Hopefully, it won&#8217;t be too long before I&#8217;m able to regularly write again.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m really far behind with my blogging. A lot has happened.

released a video discussing how to implement <strong>lazy loading</strong> in a website using a single line of CSS (per class/element, of course). This is something that was typically done using JavaScript to speed up initial load of a website. The idea is that images wouldn&#8217;t all load when a page is first delivered, which leads to performance issues. Instead, images at the top of a page would be delivered first, and then other images would be delivered as needed &#8211; basically as the user scrolls to them. This leads to a performance increase on initial page load, but could potentially result in jumping or staggering behavior on a page as its scrolled.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how this would affect Single Page Applications (like those build using React with React Router) since all of a site&#8217;s resources are supposed to be delivered at once and then rendered by the client as needed, instead of sending requests back-and-forth to the server, but I did leave a comment on the video to inquire, so we&#8217;ll see if there&#8217;s a ready answer.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the video:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AActXSWxsRo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>The behavior is implemented by adding the <strong>loading=&#8217;lazy&#8217;</strong> attribute to an &lt;img&gt; tag. Its that easy &#8211; and it works with iframes (for videos) too!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Kevin Powell just released a video discussing how to implement lazy loading in a website using a single line of CSS (per class/element, of course).

Its been hard to find time recently. We made the move from NY to CA and have been living here for about a month now. For the first two weeks, we stayed at my sister&#8217;s place in Yorba Linda while we drove out to Santa Clarita to find a place of our own. Eventually, we did land a place, and what makes it funny to me is that it was the first place we looked at. We checked out a bunch of houses for rent, apartments, townhouses, gated communities and the like, and eventually went with the first townhouse that we&#8217;d seen because it offered the most space and the company came down on price twice for my wife (it pays to negotiate).</p>\n<p>Last week on Monday, we got the keys, and now, the Friday of the following week, we&#8217;ve got furniture in all of the rooms except for what will become my office, and we have internet (Spectrum, which I&#8217;m leery of because in NY they have a bad reputation &#8211; they&#8217;re the re-branded Time-Warner and were sued by the city for false advertising and false claims of speeds that aren&#8217;t actually supported by the copper wire that they use). They were the only company that offered high speed in our area though &#8211; AT&amp;T could only offer 75MB down, while Spectrum claims up to 960MB (we went with the 400MB package, which is enough for us).</p>\n<p><div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/06\\/26\\/june-2020-update\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

My wife scored a fantastic deal on a refrigerator, washer and dryer from a family who were moving to a bigger place that already had appliances &#8211; $600 for all three! The washer was allegedly only a few weeks old. We had some help moving them to our place (our agent had two of her son&#8217;s football-player-sized friends help with the move) and I installed everything. The water lines were fine, but I was a little concerned after setting up the dryer because it uses gas, so we had a plumber come by and give it the once over. He confirmed that I&#8217;d done everything properly, but gave me some sealing compound to use to assuage my fears.</p>\n<p><div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/06\\/26\\/june-2020-update\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 451px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"451\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 451px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"451\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/06/26/june-2020-update/104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"447\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1846\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"528,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n.jpg?w=165\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n.jpg?w=528\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n.jpg?w=246&#038;h=447&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"447\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"447\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n\" alt=\"104610385_10220084852646620_4740325289162630941_n\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 447px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 451px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"451\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/06/26/june-2020-update/105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"447\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1847\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"528,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n.jpg?w=165\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n.jpg?w=528\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n.jpg?w=246&#038;h=447&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"447\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"447\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n\" alt=\"105050041_10220084853126632_9011069450956352724_n\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 447px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div></p>\n<p>The kiddos have settled in, although with Coronavirus in effect, they&#8217;re spending a lot of time watching TV and the older one is glued to her tablet. My sister spent the night last week, so we had our first guest, and her husband and his cousin also visited. Its nice to be able to host people, even briefly, in our own place. We&#8217;ve been throwing the girls on video-chats with my parents back home in NY pretty frequently, to keep them connected. My brother, his wife and his 10-month-old son have moved into the house there and are also in chat with us &#8211; the girls like seeing their little cousin grow. He&#8217;s learning to walk now.</p>\n<p>We also met some of our neighbors, and so far, they&#8217;re a really fun bunch. The ones directly on our side have 3 girls &#8211; I think 5, 12 and 17 years old, but I might be wrong. The ones past them have a twins, I think &#8211; a boy and a girl who are either 3 or 4. Our kids get along pretty well. The first family are also interesting to me because the husband is close friends with the person who runs the Warped Tour and knows a lot of bands. His wife is a punker and does some kind of technical support from home. He used to work as a manager in the music industry for about 15 years, so he knows a lot of the newer metal and related acts that have toured &#8211; people like Shadow&#8217;s Fall and that scene. He&#8217;s also friends with a lot of the larger punk acts from the mid-90s and on. I think he&#8217;s a little older than me, and while he&#8217;s not into the heavier stuff I&#8217;m into (death, black, grind, etc.) he&#8217;s more into 80s metal and, from what I can discern, some light thrash. When I find time, we might all hit shows together.</p>\n<p><div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/06\\/26\\/june-2020-update\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

When I last posted, it was the day that I was going to take the sprint challenge for it, and I passed. We moved on from there to back-end, starting with Node and Express. So far I like both &#8211; and the instructor, <strong>Jason Maurer</strong> &#8211; but I wasn&#8217;t able to complete all of the projects due to our move. All of the driving and house-hunting just devoured my time. I was able to attend all of the lectures in that first sprint, but without having worked on the projects, I wasn&#8217;t able to complete the sprint challenge.</p>\n<p>The following week, and this week, we moved on to Data Persistence, which is largely relational databases. For the first time, I missed the lectures. All of them. And the classes in-between. I had expected something like this to happen, and weeks ago, I had reached out to Student Success to let them know that it might happen. I was hoping to take a hiatus from the program to work on the move and settling in, but I wasn&#8217;t able to get approved for a hiatus initially. When they got back to me, I had already started a build week project as the React II/Senior React Developer with a team and didn&#8217;t want to abandon them, so I told Student Success that I&#8217;d like to break after the build week.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll eventually do a write-up about this build week, but for now, our project was called <strong>Sojourn</strong> and was based off of the <strong>Expat Journal</strong> project that Lambda usually offers in its menu of projects. Being the React II person was a completely different experience than React I. I had to rely on both the React I person&#8217;s work and the back-end developer&#8217;s work and coordinate with them a lot. It was harder with the back-end person, because he&#8217;d also just returned from a hiatus and wasn&#8217;t yet caught back up.</p>\n<p><p class=\"jetpack-slideshow-noscript robots-nocontent\">This slideshow requires JavaScript.</p><div id=\"gallery-1831-1-slideshow\" class=\"jetpack-slideshow-window jetpack-slideshow jetpack-slideshow-black\" data-trans=\"fade\" data-autostart=\"1\" data-gallery=\"[{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/06\\/sojourn-1.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1852&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;sojourn-1&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;itemprop&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/06\\/sojourn-2.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1853&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;sojourn-2&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;itemprop&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/06\\/sojourn-3.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1854&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;sojourn-3&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;itemprop&quot;:&quot;image&quot;},{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https:\\/\\/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2020\\/06\\/sojourn-4.jpg&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;1855&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;sojourn-4&quot;,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;itemprop&quot;:&quot;image&quot;}]\" itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ImageGallery\"></div></p>\n<p>That didn&#8217;t happen, so I struggled through Node/Express and then fell flat with Data Persistence. Student Success did reach out to me, but it was a slow process, and as of two days ago, I&#8217;ve been removed from WEBPT14 and will rejoin WEBPT16 on July 6th. I&#8217;ll be repeating Advanced Web Applications and build week, which is fine to me, because I&#8217;d like to practice those more, and then I&#8217;ll move on to Node and the rest after. My concern is that I had wanted a slightly longer period off &#8211; I&#8217;m getting the week off that the school is giving to everyone, but my wife&#8217;s new job starts on July 6th, so I&#8217;ll be alone with the kids, which is really difficult when you&#8217;re trying to focus on lectures in Zoom.</p>\n<p>Currently, when I have class, my wife takes the kids away, to another room or outside. If they&#8217;re around, I can&#8217;t hear anything. Its really hard to make a 2.5 year-old understand how to be quiet, and if she needs changing or feeding or just general comfort, she makes it known. the 7.5 year-old is also very noisy if she&#8217;s not occupied with her tablet or something else. On the west coast, Lambda classes are from 4:30 &#8211; 6:30. Back in NY, with the 3-hour difference, they started at 7:30, so my wife was home and able to help. I&#8217;m basically assured that I won&#8217;t be able to focus on the live lectures from this point forward, so I&#8217;ll attend to the best of my ability and then repeat the process by watching the video recordings when they&#8217;re released the next day. Its nice to have that option, but I won&#8217;t be able to actively participate as much as I generally try to, and I won&#8217;t be able to ask the instructor questions during the lectures.</p>\n<p>The Student Success person who worked with me basically told me that in order to remain fair to the other students, some of who weren&#8217;t given the 2nd hiatus opportunity that I have, he couldn&#8217;t push out my start date. I understand that, and don&#8217;t want to make any of the other students feel like their voices and concerns haven&#8217;t been heard, so I didn&#8217;t press the issue, but from what I can tell, he&#8217;s about 20 years younger than me and doesn&#8217;t seem to have kids, so he likely won&#8217;t understand the difficulty in transition. If my sister lived closer, she&#8217;d be around to help watch the kids for those 2-3 hours, during lecture, but right now, its not an option. I know other people work through much more trying circumstances than what I&#8217;m in, so I&#8217;m going to make the best of it &#8211; I&#8217;ve told people that I marvel at how single parents can manage this stuff.</p>\n<h2>Side projects</h2>\n<p>Breast Cancer Comfort is coming along. I haven&#8217;t made any major updates to the website, but we&#8217;re meeting next week via Zoom, so I&#8217;ll see what comes next. I know that we want to build-in a better storefront. Right now, we&#8217;re using Etsy, and they&#8217;re considering Shopify or another platform. The final decision hasn&#8217;t been made though. One of our volunteers, <strong>Alaha Nasari</strong>, also just won a $20,000 grant and got <a href=\"https://www.newsday.com/long-island/education/graduations/hicksville-senior-science-mentoring-program-1.45360196\">written up in Newsday.</a> She does some writing for us and is a high school senior. I&#8217;m really impressed by her ability and I love that she takes time to work with younger students to help teach them science. I think we&#8217;ll link to some of that on the website.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also started working on a resource for beginning web developers that basically explains some coding concepts and gives code examples. Its based on what I&#8217;ve done at Lambda and some outside resources (read: Google) that I&#8217;ve used. I&#8217;m calling it the <strong>Code Conspectus</strong>, and I&#8217;ve modeled some of its appearance after 1st and 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons. I haven&#8217;t gotten to work on it in some weeks, but I&#8217;m going to try to squeeze in time during this little hiatus. Once I&#8217;ve completed enough, I&#8217;ll share it and then see if anyone else wants to contribute to it &#8211; but since its geared towards beginners (like myself) I want to make sure that people keep that in mind when writing.</p>\n<p>I also learned some <strong>Markdown</strong> to work on this project. I really like Markdown so far. Most of my project will be shared pages on GitHub, and Markdown lets me format the files, but more importantly &#8211; it lets me include code snippets with highlighting! I had tried some JS libraries for this but wasn&#8217;t happy with the results. Markdown proved to be a really simple way to implement pages with text, links, images and code snippets.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1856\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/06/26/june-2020-update/code-conspectus-cover/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1349,625\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"code-conspectus-cover\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1856\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg\" alt=\"code-conspectus-cover\" width=\"1349\" height=\"625\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg 1349w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=150&amp;h=69 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=300&amp;h=139 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=768&amp;h=356 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/code-conspectus-cover.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=474 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1349px) 100vw, 1349px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok.

I&#8217;ve read a bunch of things that I really want to share &#8211; some are tech-related and some are related to the job hunt and other things. I also want to work on Lambda projects and the Code Conspectus though, so we&#8217;ll see how things go over the next week or so.

post this to give some perspective about where I am with regard to the curriculum at <strong><a href=\"https://learn.lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda</a>,</strong> but also to see how much further I have yet to go &#8211; and that&#8217;s only to complete the <em>academic</em> portion of the program. This map doesn&#8217;t show any of the <em>experiential</em> side of the bootcamp that happens after all of the academics are complete (Lambda X and whatever the other programs are called).</p>\n<p>Build Weeks give us a taste of interdisciplinary projects, but there are much bigger group projects that get funding and turn into actual companies. Also, and this probably goes without saying: learning doesn&#8217;t stop when the program is complete. For this particular bootcamp, this (and the experiential stuff that&#8217;s not included here) is what they view as entry-level for a full-stack web developer.</p>\n<p>If I pass my sprint challenge later today, I&#8217;ll have completed the first 3 units of material (up to Advanced Web Applications). With regard to blogging, I&#8217;m up to Unit 2, Sprint 6, lesson 3: Component Side Effects, as of this writing. Getting here hasn&#8217;t been a straightforward process for me, as I&#8217;ve flexed twice, switched from full-time to part-time and taken a hiatus. It also doesn&#8217;t include the pre-course work, which went over basic HTML and JavaScript and is about two weeks&#8217; worth of material for the average person.</p>\n<p>Each unit is comprised of 3 <strong>sprints</strong> that are in turn made up of 4 <strong>lessons</strong> and a <strong>sprint challenge</strong> (the sprint challenges aren&#8217;t listed, only the lessons). After 3 sprints, a <strong>Build Week</strong> occurs. With each Build Week, your role changes. The first time, you&#8217;ll design and build a landing page/website for your team&#8217;s product. The second time, you&#8217;ll be a React I/JavaScript developer. The third time, you&#8217;ll be a React II developer, then you move on to the back end, and so on. This also only covers the web developer track. I haven&#8217;t analyzed the other tracks, like iOS, Android, Data Science, UI/UX and so on. They have their own sprints.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1813\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/05/15/lambda-school-units-and-sprints-as-of-may-2020/banner-red-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png\" data-orig-size=\"1200,153\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"banner-red-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1813\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png\" alt=\"banner-red-1\" width=\"1200\" height=\"153\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png 1200w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=150&amp;h=19 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=300&amp;h=38 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=768&amp;h=98 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/banner-red-1.png?w=1024&amp;h=131 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></p>\n<h2>Unit 1: Web Fundamentals</h2>\n<h3>1.

CS Unit 2 Build</h3>\n<p>There&#8217;s an annex for <strong>Computer Science</strong> too, as that curriculum has also changed. We&#8217;re able to access older material from the annex, including projects. Lambda is constantly revising its material to keep up with industry changes. There are also additional units that aren&#8217;t part of the core curriculum but are offered for free to all students and alumni, like a unit about <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>. I think that backend (Unit 4) might have recently been changed to solely focus on <strong>Node,</strong> with the <strong>Java</strong> option being moved to the annex as well.</p>\n<p>Also, someone on the LambdaSchool subreddit on Reddit shared the following post, and I read it while watching the kids earlier today.

At the end of the week, we&#8217;ll fly out with the kids and stay at my sister&#8217;s place while looking for a place of our own for the next 2-3 years, until we can hopefully save up and find a more permanent home in Santa Clarita.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1798\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1798\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1798\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/05/15/may-2020-update/sleeping/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,1067\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sleeping\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg?w=768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1798\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping\" width=\"800\" height=\"1067\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg 800w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg?w=225&amp;h=300 225w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sleeping.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1024 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1798\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">So, the wife was happy to share that when I passed out with the little one last week, she gave me a makeover. Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t know this and when I woke up, I attended my Zoom with my Lambda group wearing it. No one there mentioned anything either, although I got a few looks.</p></div></p>\n<h3>Lambda School</h3>\n<p>Later today is my sprint challenge for Advanced Web Applications at Lambda. Once its done, if I pass, I&#8217;ll have completed the front-end portion of the full-stack web developer track. I&#8217;m behind though. There are projects from this sprint that I didn&#8217;t finish yet and a scattering of projects from other units that I also need to complete. Build Week is next week as well.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m really worried about Build Week this time around. I&#8217;ll be a React II developer on this project. For those of you who don&#8217;t know, BW is a week-long period at Lambda (2 weeks, if you&#8217;re part-time) in which people from different tracks come together into teams and build a project from start-to-finish. We&#8217;ll have people from different phases of the web developer track (HTML/CSS people to build a landing page, React I to work on some of the front-end, React II to work on more of the application&#8217;s functions, backend people, maybe someone from UI/UX, an iOS person and an Android person &#8211; and sometimes a data science person) saddle up and work collaboratively. Its a lot of fun for me. I enjoy actually putting what we&#8217;ve learned to use and bouncing ideas around with other people and just meeting other people who are learning development and/or design. However, this time, its happening as we move to CA.</p>\n<p>My sister lives in Yorba Linda. We&#8217;re going to be in Santa Clarita. YL is like 90 mins east of Los Angeles. SC is about 90 mins north of it. When we were last there, it actually took my wife and I about 2 hours and 20 mins to get from YL to SC. Getting back took longer, because it was later in the day and traffic was worse. We&#8217;re bringing the kids with us, but leaving them at my sister&#8217;s when we look at houses. The little one still throws up after 20 mins in a car. There&#8217;s going to be a huge chunk taken out of my time each day just in transit, and then there&#8217;s the time to meet with the relocation people and look at houses, apartments, gated communities and whatever else is lined up. I&#8217;m a slow coder. I&#8217;m not going to have as much time as I think I need to dedicate to my Build Week team&#8217;s project, and it bothers me.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t want to ruin someone&#8217;s Build Week. For the HTML/CSS people, it&#8217;ll be their first experience with this. I brought it up during my last standup, which was with a different TL and team, because Slack was actually down this week, and it affected Lambda, along with thousands of other companies across the globe. My regular TL couldn&#8217;t connect reliably, and even I and most of (if not all of) Lambda and probably the rest of the world was locked out for about 2 hours.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1800\" style=\"width: 1220px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1800\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1800\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/05/15/may-2020-update/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1210,893\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1800\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg\" alt=\"santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda\" width=\"1210\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg 1210w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=150&amp;h=111 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=300&amp;h=221 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=768&amp;h=567 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/santa-clarita-to-yorba-linda.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=756 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1210px) 100vw, 1210px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1800\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Santa Clarita to Yorba Linda. L.A. traffic included at no charge!</p></div></p>\n<p>Anyway, that TL asked us how we felt about the upcoming Build Week, and I told him that I had mixed feelings about it. I explained that normally, I look forward to Build Week, but that I had (earlier that day, in fact) messaged Student Success about taking a hiatus after the sprint challenge this week, as I&#8217;d have completed the front-end portion of the curriculum. I explained that we were about to move and that when we&#8217;d last spoken, they said that we could discuss options once I was ready to move. They told me that because I had already had a hiatus, they couldn&#8217;t offer me another one.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s really a letdown for me. As I said, I&#8217;m a slow coder. It takes me longer than most people to finish projects, and to just think through processes. I was hoping for a reprieve to focus on family and finding a home &#8211; even if its only a temporary one. I also wanted to use the time to catch up on unfinished projects, review material and write some of the posts I need to for this blog (I&#8217;m way behind still). Its not going to happen, and I&#8217;m also most likely going to be the weakest link on my BW team and let them down.</p>\n<p>That TL actually asked me if he could share this with other TLs and see if they could come up with something to help me. I told him it was fine, as I ultimately don&#8217;t care what happens to me. I could definitely use a refresher if I need to flex and run through this material again with a new cohort. I just really don&#8217;t want to disappoint my BW team. These projects can be great additions to a portfolio, they display an array of skills, both technical and social. I tend to go hard on my projects and would want to contribute my best work, but I&#8217;m overwhelmed.</p>\n<p>The TLs got back to me yesterday through my regular TL (that&#8217;s team lead, I just realized I&#8217;ve been using the acronym w/o explanation this whole time). They said that they could go easy on me with attendance if I need to skip on class time to work on projects or go through material. While I appreciate the offer, I don&#8217;t see how it would help. Yesterday was my last lecture for front-end. So, there is no more class time. Later today is the sprint challenge, then build week and the move take place. I basically responded and thanked my TL for the offer but told him that right now, I don&#8217;t see a good path forward so I&#8217;m going to just try to put in as much effort as I can to make it through.</p>\n<p>This is the first time I&#8217;ve actually felt let-down at Lambda. In the past, it felt like the support was really there, and to be fair, the TLs are listening and trying to help. What I really need though is focused time to relocate my family and then time to catch up on projects and fill in the gaps in my knowledge. Student Success could potentially provide that, but its not coming.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1803\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/05/15/may-2020-update/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,256\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1803\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg\" alt=\"signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting\" width=\"640\" height=\"256\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg 640w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg?w=150&amp;h=60 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/signs-not-to-be-a-programmer-sitting.jpg?w=300&amp;h=120 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></p>\n<h3>Co-Workers</h3>\n<p>On a more positive note, I emailed my old team at work yesterday. Its been super-quiet since we went into maintenance mode. We&#8217;ve all basically moved on, with everyone working at different companies and me maintaining the servers and other technologies needed to keep our application running until the end of when we&#8217;re federally-required to host our clients&#8217; clinical data.</p>\n<p>The response was great. I apologized again to the developers for not actually being a developer when we were building the last incarnation of our EMR. I told them more about Lambda and what I&#8217;m learning, and my plan to become a web developer. They were very happy for me. They&#8217;re excited about the move to CA, have offered advice from their own development experiences and really laid out why I shouldn&#8217;t feel any regrets for not having been a developer and working with them through code instead of how I&#8217;d gone about things. They reiterated that I was the person who held the company together after our founder passed, which made me feel both happy and sad at the same time. I spoke with one of them on the phone at length for a while, and with everyone else on email. We&#8217;re going to have a Zoom this weekend and see each other&#8217;s faces for the first time in years.</p>\n<p>I really miss my team. That development team is what I think of when I hear the word &#8220;team&#8221;. We had each other&#8217;s backs, worked hard together, planned and trouble-shot together. Each of us highlighted the strengths of everyone else. All of the pieces just fit. I hope I have that again someday. I miss my old boss, our founder. She was the smartest person I&#8217;ve ever met, and the most ethical. She empowered us and was like a second mother to me. Melanoma took her from us, and she fought it to the bitter end. She was utterly stoic when it came to herself, and worked until she wasn&#8217;t able to speak from bed anymore. I don&#8217;t know if her work/life balance was evenly distributed, but she raised 5 kids by herself as a widow and built 3 companies. They just don&#8217;t make people like her anymore.</p>\n<p>But, yeah, we&#8217;re Zooming this weekend. I really look forward to it. Two of the team (not developers though) already live in CA, but 5-6 hours north of where we&#8217;ll be. I&#8217;m hoping to see them at some point &#8211; one of them had just gotten married when I last spoke with her, and in her email, she relayed that she and her husband had just recently bought &#8220;the ugliest house in the nicest neighborhood&#8221; where they live and are now overwhelmed with DIY projects because its a fixer-upper. The other one had just sold her house and was moving somewhere else in CA when I last spoke with her &#8211; she offered to let us just stay with her and operate out of her place until we found one of our own, and while I really appreciated the offer, I told her we&#8217;re staying at my sister&#8217;s place. The distance is just too far to travel regularly from up north where she is, to Santa Clarita.</p>\n<p><div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1805\" style=\"width: 2239px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1805\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1805\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/05/15/may-2020-update/img_3277/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"2229,1664\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;iPhone 4&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1339940437&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;3.85&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.066666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"IMG_3277\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1805\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg\" alt=\"IMG_3277\" width=\"2229\" height=\"1664\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg 2229w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=150&amp;h=112 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=300&amp;h=224 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=768&amp;h=573 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/img_3277.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=764 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2229px) 100vw, 2229px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1805\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">June 2012.

Cancer Comfort Update (April 24, 2020)","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/24/breast-cancer-comfort-update-april-24-2020/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-sr","content":"<p>I&#8217;m a little behind with projects at Lambda School, but the past two days were productive with <strong><a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/\">Breast Cancer Comfort</a></strong>. On Wednesday (April 22nd) I spoke with <strong>Ray Kimmelblatt</strong>, a long-time friend of <strong>Debi Cavolo</strong>, the organization&#8217;s founder. Ray is helping BCC with fundraising. I Googled her the day before our phone conversation and found that she&#8217;s very seasoned. She works with the <strong><a href=\"https://www.jdrf.org/\">JDRF</a></strong> (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and other organizations and has been key in their success. Her experience with fundraising and event planning stretches to around two decades.</p>\n<p>The call was really informative. We looked over the website together and she made suggestions as to how we could improve it. I took notes, but later on, she emailed me her own notes, which were similar to mine but more fleshed-out. I added some items from mine, and from messages with other people at BCC and used that to enhance the website last night.</p>\n<p>Yesterday (April 23rd), Debi hosted a <strong>Zoom</strong> meeting with a bunch of people who are contributing to BCC. Ray and I were on the call. Some of the meeting was about finances and general status. The parts which I was mainly focused on were web-related, especially regarding the website. I used clarifications from the meeting and my own notes to detail Ray&#8217;s further and guide my time working on the website last night. I also used the document to explain why some parts of the website had evolved to where they stand, which was generally a combination of my own design thoughts coupled with input or requests from other people at the foundation. This was all ultimately reigned in by what I&#8217;m able to do with <strong>Divi</strong>. I still have a hard time making myself not compare it to just coding with React/JSX. I&#8217;m learning to work within its framework, however.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1774\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/24/breast-cancer-comfort-update-april-24-2020/bcc-about-us/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1106,738\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-about-us\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1774\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg\" alt=\"bcc-about-us\" width=\"1106\" height=\"738\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg 1106w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-about-us.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1106px) 100vw, 1106px\" /></p>\n<p>A quick summary of changes to the website include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Added preliminary &#8220;About Us&#8221; page</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;Make a Gift&#8221; button to Donate page. Links to Network For Good.</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;Visit Our Store&#8221; button to Boobtique page. Links to Etsy.</li>\n<li>Removed &#8220;Uncategorized&#8221; category from blog posts that had them</li>\n<li>Added &#8220;Updates&#8221; category to those posts</li>\n<li>Removed existing footer and created a block in Divi to replace it</li>\n<li>Reordered menu</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of these tasks took longer than others, like adding the buttons required me to create a custom background image to mirror what I had just done with CSS in the mockup site on Netlify. Replacing the footer also took some time to design. Implementing it was relatively quick.</p>\n<p>The document I&#8217;m working from is 3 pages long, and is dominated by blue text from me with changes I want to make, followed by green text with changes I&#8217;ve made. A bunch of enhancements need further work before I can implement them. Some are design decisions from the team. Others are content-related. This ranges from adding a Board of Directors section, Sponsors page and a link for volunteers to apply to join the organization to deciding if we&#8217;re staying with <strong>Etsy</strong> (which one of the other team members needs to revamp) or if we&#8217;re switching to <strong>Shopify</strong> or another storefront.</p>\n<p>There are smaller design decisions that need to be made too, like changes to the layout of the home page, adding an &#8220;In Honor Of&#8221; wall to compliment the &#8220;In Memory Of&#8221; wall that&#8217;s already on the site &#8211; we need people to show interest in that first though. There are also some small text changes that I forgot to quickly make last night. I&#8217;ll make them right after I post this though.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1775\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/24/breast-cancer-comfort-update-april-24-2020/bcc-make-a-gift/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1107,778\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-make-a-gift\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1775\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg\" alt=\"bcc-make-a-gift\" width=\"1107\" height=\"778\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg 1107w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=300&amp;h=211 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=768&amp;h=540 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-make-a-gift.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=720 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1107px) 100vw, 1107px\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad the organization is moving forward and I&#8217;m glad to have a hand in it, through the website design and implementation. There is a technical issue I want to resolve, but I haven&#8217;t reached out to anyone about it yet. Currently, the address is <a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/</a>. I don&#8217;t want the trailing /home/ to be part of the default address. I had removed it, back in December last year, and I made some corresponding changes outside of WordPress in the domain settings at the DNS site, but it broke the site. It couldn&#8217;t be accessed. It took me a few hours to find a workaround and be able to access the WP Admin and use some special tools to edit the configuration files for the website to make things work again. I want to revisit this and find someone at WordPress who can help me to make the proper changes and get the site working at <a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/</a> without the /home/ part.</p>\n<p>While writing this, I also reflected on the feeling I&#8217;ve been getting while working on this project. I have checklists of development tasks to complete. Some of them involve programming (I&#8217;ve been adding in custom CSS where its helpful in WP/Divi) and others revolve more around design and implementation. I got to thinking about working at my regular job, and how it was when we were really in the thick of it, making major upgrades. I did a lot of the design work there, and testing. I&#8217;m finally starting to get what I imagine the feeling is that our developers got when they implemented a feature or made changes to the application that then affected workflows or visual impression of the site. I think some of this is due to having a Zoom call with the BCC team and getting their input and acting on it, but I&#8217;m finally starting to get a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from this. Its like I&#8217;m taking client requests and making them come to life.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1776\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/24/breast-cancer-comfort-update-april-24-2020/bcc-visit-our-store/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1108,777\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-visit-our-store\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1776\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg\" alt=\"bcc-visit-our-store\" width=\"1108\" height=\"777\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg 1108w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=150&amp;h=105 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=300&amp;h=210 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=768&amp;h=539 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-visit-our-store.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=718 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1108px) 100vw, 1108px\" /></p>\n<p>Ok. I&#8217;m going to make those quick changes to the site and then look at the Lambda projects I need to finish. I also started writing a post earlier this week about <strong>component side effects</strong> in React (essentially the <strong>useEffect</strong> hook) and need to finish that as well. I&#8217;m about 700 words in but only 1/3 through the material there that I want to write about. I&#8217;m a little worried because it feels like I&#8217;m hitting a burnout period again. We just looked at <strong>reducers</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong> at Lambda and are going over <strong>asynchronous Redux</strong> and then the <strong>Context API</strong> before our next sprint challenge. Sometimes, onward and upward makes my wings tired.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m a little behind with projects at Lambda School, but the past two days were productive with Breast Cancer Comfort.

I&#8217;ve been making progress at Lambda, and I&#8217;m finally starting to feel like I understand React at a basic level. I&#8217;m still behind on blog posts about it though. Right now we&#8217;re 7 lessons ahead in the curriculum than I&#8217;ve written about (not including individual posts about projects). When I was in WEBPT10, we were *13* lessons ahead of where I am with writing right now, and I was further behind in blogging about it, so&#8230; progress.</p>\n<h3>Fetching data</h3>\n<p>These last few days though&#8230; Friday&#8217;s project was to refactor <a href=\"https://vishalicious213.github.io/5.4-github-usercard-v2/\"><strong>GitHub Followers</strong></a>, an old assignment from Applied JavaScript (<a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-ii/\"><strong>Components II</strong></a>). Something in my head&#8217;s not right. I got stuck getting the data from GitHub using <strong>fetch(),</strong> so I switched to <strong>axios</strong> and found myself in the same predicament. For some reason, my syntax was wrong and I just wasn&#8217;t seeing it. It took me 90 mins to finally get it to work. I even referenced older projects and still chewed dirt for a while. It might be on account of when I do most of my coding, which is in the small hours of the night. I should still have had it done faster though.</p>\n<p>Once the data was being pulled down, I got to work. I rendered my profile&#8217;s data with no issues. <strong>Class components</strong> are different from <strong>function components</strong>, but it was workable. I do strongly prefer function components with <strong>hooks</strong> though. Once I got to the point where I was iterating through my followers and wanted to get their data onscreen, I hit a big issue: I exceeded the amount of hourly API requests I can make of GitHub almost immediately.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1746\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/12/april-2020-update/react-gh-followers-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"846,858\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"react-gh-followers-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg?w=296\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg?w=846\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1746\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg\" alt=\"react-gh-followers-01\" width=\"846\" height=\"858\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg 846w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg?w=148&amp;h=150 148w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg?w=296&amp;h=300 296w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-01.jpg?w=768&amp;h=779 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 846px) 100vw, 846px\" /></p>\n<h3>Exceeding data limits</h3>\n<p>This really hit me. I looked around and found ways to get around it using a prefix in my HTML string that uses a proxy, and it worked to a degree, but then also stopped. I researched for the rest of Friday night and finally gave up around 4:30 AM and went to bed. In the morning, I could make requests again, but I wasn&#8217;t happy. My previous JavaScript program delved a level deeper into the GitHub data and let me return data for each of my followers that I couldn&#8217;t get at the surface level with this React version.</p>\n<p>I tried stuff for a while again on Saturday before finally giving up in the evening and taking the second-best choice: I just used the surface data from the API call to my /followers path on GitHub and iterated over that data. The main issues I have are that I wanted to show real names and location, like I did in the original project. Without getting the more detailed level of data, I could only show username and no locations.</p>\n<p>I lived with it and moved on, working from that point and polishing the project. I styled it a bit and made MVP (minimal viable product). Then I started on stretch goals.</p>\n<h3>GitHub Contribution Calendar</h3>\n<p>The first one took a while. We were tasked to show our contribution calendar from GitHub in our application. There was a link to a conversation on <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34516592/embed-github-contributions-graph-in-website\">Stack Overflow</a></strong> that had a way, but I couldn&#8217;t get it to work. There were dependency issues with the installation. After more research, I found an <a href=\"https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-github-calendar\"><strong>equivalent React method</strong></a>, which did work. I was actually pretty happy with it. It shows the data and I can style it. My only issue is that I can&#8217;t remove a line of text above the SVG that has a link to my GitHub profile with with my username in it. I wanted to remove it because I have a button that links to the profile directly above it, and because it doesn&#8217;t mesh with my design. There&#8217;s no way in the library&#8217;s API to remove the line, and I tried things with CSS, but they were also to no avail, so I finally acquiesced with that, too, and moved on.</p>\n<p>I used the same library to add contribution data to all of my followers&#8217; cards in the application. This was the main reason that I wanted to remove that line. Its redundant with my design, which I just dealt with in my profile section at the top of the application, but it also repeats across all of the followers&#8217; cards when it renders their contribution calendars. This resulted in a performance hit too, which I discovered when working on the last component &#8211; and the real source of my frustrations &#8211; my search.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1747\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/12/april-2020-update/react-gh-followers-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"769,863\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"react-gh-followers-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg?w=267\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg?w=769\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1747\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg\" alt=\"react-gh-followers-02\" width=\"769\" height=\"863\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg 769w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg?w=134&amp;h=150 134w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/react-gh-followers-02.jpg?w=267&amp;h=300 267w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 769px) 100vw, 769px\" /></p>\n<h3>Search</h3>\n<p>Since yesterday, I&#8217;ve been working on the <strong>search component</strong> stretch for this project. I gave up at 5 AM today and took a nap, and then I worked on it more, earlier. I don&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m doing wrong. I&#8217;m not great at writing search components yet. I&#8217;ve done two of them. One was for the sprint challenge at Lambda for <strong>Single Page Applications</strong> that&#8217;s ahead of where I am with blogging still. The other was for a separate project I did from a YouTube tutorial that I selected specifically to build another search component. I also found one <span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">on <strong><a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/\">CodeSandbox</a></strong></span><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\"> from </span><strong style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">Christina Gorton</strong><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">, one of my previous Lambda instructors. She had shared it in Slack with another cohort.</span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure if its because I&#8217;m working with class components and have to use <strong>lifecycle methods</strong> for certain operations, but my code might not be updating state properly when it comes to taking in user data from an input and then setting it to state and re-rendering the application using a new user&#8217;s data instead of my own, which is what&#8217;s in initial state.</p>\n<p>I rewrote my code 3 times so far, and modified it through all of those 3 rewrites dozens of times. I was actually going to admit defeat and speak with a TL at Lambda during TL hours today, which is something I&#8217;ve never done before because I tend to just put my back into it and push through, but its Easter Sunday during coronavirus and I didn&#8217;t see an announcement for TL hours today. I could probably reach out to one of them, but I don&#8217;t want to interrupt their weekends for this.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m most likely going to bang my head against this for the rest of the night.</p>\n<p><div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/04\\/12\\/april-2020-update\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 147px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"147\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 147px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"147\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/march-2020-update/rick-and-morty/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"143\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1569\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"506,295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rick-and-morty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=506\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=246&#038;h=143&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"143\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"143\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"rick-and-morty\" alt=\"rick-and-morty\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 143px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 147px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"147\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/march-2020-update/10-recipes/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"143\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1570\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"506,295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"10-recipes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=506\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=246&#038;h=143&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"143\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"143\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"10-recipes\" alt=\"10-recipes\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 143px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div></p>\n<h3>COVID-19</h3>\n<p>Finally, I mentioned in a previous post that our friend Danny had passed due to complications related to <strong>coronavirus</strong>. His funeral was yesterday. We attended it online. The only people who were physically present were his wife (now, widow) and her brother and sister. His mother passed in January. His father is too old to be allowed to go. His brother has kids and lives in Texas, and the rest of us are basically not allowed to go in the flesh because of this pandemic.</p>\n<p>It was a strange experience for me. We wanted to support his wife, but we couldn&#8217;t do it physically. She and her siblings were the only people present, so only they could speak about Danny. Their eulogies were simultaneously touching and heart-breaking, especially his wife&#8217;s, who is a fantastic writer and speaker in general.</p>\n<p>The funeral home streamed the service. It took about 40 mins. After it was over, the camera remained on and we got to hear his wife completely break down, off-screen but on-air. This went on for several minutes and was stark and saddening. Eventually, she and her siblings started reminiscing about Danny, telling stories about him that cheered them up, talking about when he first met each of them, how their family reacted to him and how he broke their preconceptions about him.</p>\n<p>Like my wife and I, they&#8217;re a mixed-race couple. Danny is Chinese and his wife is black. He&#8217;s probably northern, because he&#8217;s at least six feet tall, like my Chinese co-workers who are all northern. They told a story about how, when he first met a group of their cousins, they asked him what he liked to eat and apologized for not having noodles. He replied by detailing how he loved oxtail and mac-and-cheese. His wife talked about how he never asked for it, but also never turned down a plate of fried chicken. They talked about cosplay and gaming and piano and how he acted when they all first met. They talked about how the undiagnosed diabetes took its toll on him, and how in his final years, he had lost the ability to ambulate, and how his computer gaming turned to tablet gaming. As a couple, they played a lot of tabletop RPGs together, and other card and board games. Their gaming group was expansive. It was them that introduced me and a group of my friends to <strong><a href=\"https://bt4wall.wordpress.com/2017/10/07/tabletop-games-munchkin-magic-maze/\">Munchkin</a></strong> and some other games, during one of our backyard barbecues.</p>\n<p>My wife and I were talking about how Danny&#8217;s wife is holding together; about how she&#8217;s been putting on a strong front but has been dealing with so much, both before Danny&#8217;s passing and now after. Due to COVID-19, people can&#8217;t even be physically present to comfort her. Her mother lives near to her, in an apartment, but isn&#8217;t allowed to be out in this clime due to her age and health. New York has been hit especially hard. Morgues are acting as secondary storage for hospitals here. In some of the boroughs, there are mass graves being dug because facilities weren&#8217;t equipped to deal with the fallout of the virus, and its not even as bad as it could be due to social distancing and self-quarantining.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m taking a break. The baby just woke from a late nap, so she&#8217;s going to be up. I&#8217;m not getting anywhere with my search feature, so I&#8217;ll probably reach out to a TL tomorrow if I don&#8217;t figure something out tonight. Keep safe everyone, and for those of you struggling through learning how to think like a programmer and build web applications, hang in there. Take time to clear your heads, and try to find someone more experienced to guide you. I&#8217;m going to do that. I actually began writing this post as a part of that, to help get some of this out of my head.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m frustrated.

I&#8217;m awaiting copy for the second one, which should come from a new volunteer at the organization.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1721\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/05/breast-cancer-comfort-update-april-5-2020/bcc-newsite-v2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1096,835\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-newsite-v2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1721\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg\" alt=\"bcc-newsite-v2\" width=\"1096\" height=\"835\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg 1096w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=229 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=585 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/bcc-newsite-v2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=780 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1096px) 100vw, 1096px\" /></p>\n<p>Building the carousel was time-consuming. <strong>Divi</strong> doesn&#8217;t have a module for that, natively. There were some that could be purchased as add-ins to the program, but I actually found a free CSS solution from a website called <strong><a href=\"https://divisoup.com/\">Divi Soup</a></strong> that I was able to put to work. The time-sink was getting images that were equal in size so that the slideshow didn&#8217;t have images that were 2-3 times as long as others.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://divisoup.com/r41-how-to-create-a-scrolling-module-carousel-in-divi/\">Divi Soup &#8211; R41: How to create a scrolling module carousel in Divi</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I went through available pictures from BCC&#8217;s media library on WordPress and chose some to work with. That&#8217;s how I saw that having images that were different sizes was going to be a problem, even with a toggle turned on in the image component that made their heights all fill the container (it didn&#8217;t). I edited the files in my ancient copy of Photoshop and foolishly made the widths the same. It did nothing. I had been hoping to do that and then see if that height toggle would work, but I was thinking about it the wrong way. I then edited the files again and made the heights the same. It also didn&#8217;t work. I&#8217;m unclear now if that was an issue on my thinking or if it would have worked, because re-examining the files showed that some hadn&#8217;t saved with the changes and maintained their previous heights.</p>\n<p>Finally I just made all of the images the same size (449 x 449 px) which cropped some and added whitespace (which I colored a light gray) to the tops and bottoms of some. That worked.</p>\n<p>I had tried using custom CSS in the module, but it didn&#8217;t work. Some test parameters worked, like changing the background color and adding a border to the module, just to see if it was actually reading and processing what I had input, but others didn&#8217;t, which is why I had given up and modified the images directly.</p>\n<p>With the carousel in-place, I tinkered with the site more and was able to find a way to correct an issue that had been bothering me for a long time &#8211; a gift box icon that I had used as a sort of bullet in the original mockup that I wrote in HTML/CSS/JS was way too big in the Divi version. I had tried to fix it several times before, but never had any success.</p>\n<p>Today, I rebuilt each section from scratch and used a new layout in Divi, which finally worked. I had tinkered with custom CSS to try and correct this for a long time too, also to no avail. The end result was that I remade every one of those modules, but now it all works.</p>\n<p>Finally, because custom CSS was failing me (I&#8217;m really not a fan of Divi at all now) I also wasn&#8217;t able to use media queries the way that I wanted so that I could remove the gift box icons and shrink text and remove some images from some pages for mobile and tablet views, so I duplicated all of the modules that I had just re-created and made alternate versions of every one for mobile/tablet screens and changed visibility on all of the modules so that some only appeared at desktop view and others on mobile/tablet view.</p>\n<p>It all works, and I can move forward again, but its frustrating to want to code but have to use these other tools on account of client preference. I&#8217;m doing it because they think its best for them, in case they need to make updates and I&#8217;m not available, but it really feels confining to me, and it makes what I view as simple layout tasks far more difficult than they need to be.</p>\n<p>This is a good example of the work that we do that doesn&#8217;t show up as a green square in our GitHub profile for potential employers to look at.</p>\n<p>So, I emailed Debi and one other person there with an update and a list of assets that I still need to build out the site more, but for now, its working but needs some tweaks. There are some design choices I want to speak with them about &#8211; for example, I think the carousel should go to the top and the video that&#8217;s there now should return to the bottom where I originally had it. That video also has images flanking it now, but they don&#8217;t add anything and I removed them from mobile view because they were crowding the screen and shrinking the video.</p>\n<p>I think that if this was hand-coded, I could make it work though. I could shrink the flanking videos more easily and make them responsive and put three on each side, like how one of the other people at BCC wanted it. Its a chore to try and do it with Divi. CSS Grid could do it in a minute, as could Flexbox.</p>\n<p>Anyway. I hope everyone is trying to keep safe from this rampant coronavirus. We lost a friend to it last week, when I was writing a post about <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/02/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-composing-react-components-and-passing-data-via-props-1-of-2/\"><strong>React</strong></a>. His name was Danny. He was only 47. He had diabetes that had gone undiagnosed until he was around 40 and was immuno-compromised and needed a liver transplant. He leaves behind his wife, but no children. Keep safe, everyone.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/\">Breast Cancer Comfort homepage</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, yesterday, I had a Zoom call with Debi from Breast Cancer Comfort.

ambda School: Full Stack – Unit 2, Sprint 6: Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props Project","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/04/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-composing-react-components-and-passing-data-via-props-project/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-rl","content":"<p>The project for our <strong>Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props</strong> lesson was to &#8220;build a simple Instagram clone using React&#8221;. I&#8217;ve never thought of Instagram, Facebook, Twitter or the like as simple, but looking at each of them as an assemblage of components, I can start to see how they&#8217;re put together. While we don&#8217;t yet know how to write a component for authentication, to login and logout of an application, and we haven&#8217;t learned how to create a database or use local storage yet, so that we can have persistent data, we do know enough to build out most of the front-end of a social media application now.</p>\n<p>I initially had to do this project in WEBPT10, but I never got to, because at the point that it came up, I was already behind and was trying to catch back up. I had read through the material &#8211; enough to pass the sprint challenge &#8211; but I hadn&#8217;t completed all of the projects, so this is my first time actually working through it, in WEBPT14.</p>\n<p>So, we&#8217;re provided with some mock data in a dummy-data file. Each object in the file represented a faux Instagram post. We had to read that data and use it to render each post, separately. The description said that the project was broken into two main parts, a search bar and a posts section.</p>\n<p>The search bar renders at the top of the page and is a single instance that&#8217;s persistent across the application. Below it, the post section renders a post and comment section for every entry in the mock data file. We also had to add and update state for the likes button so that it increments whenever the button is clicked, and style the page using CSS. In this case our .css files each lived in the same directory as the component they served.</p>\n<p>Like the previous project, the functionality of this application was driven by the <strong>.useState</strong> hook and the <strong>onClick</strong> handler. The former allowed us to render post data, and the two combined to allow us to update the number of likes when the like button (heart) was clicked. What differed was that the components for the <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/31/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-project/\"><strong>football scoreboard</strong></a> project existed within a single file, whereas with this project, we&#8217;re importing and exporting from multiple files, passing props downstream and updating state from a parent component which then re-rendered child components as needed.</p>\n<p>I added a single entry to the mock data, which was part of a stretch goal and I added my own styles to the application, but I didn&#8217;t add new functionality&#8230; yet. This was a fun project, so I plan on revisiting it. I&#8217;d like to add some of the stretch goals, and something of my own; making the search bar functional and adding the ability to add comments to the posts are stretches I&#8217;m interested in. I&#8217;d also like to make a small user profile section with just a username and image, but that&#8217;ll come later when I make time for a v2 of this project.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vish213-instagram.netlify.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1703\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/04/04/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-composing-react-components-and-passing-data-via-props-project/6-2-project-instagram/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,626\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"6-2 project-instagram\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg?w=800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1703\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg\" alt=\"6-2 project-instagram\" width=\"800\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg 800w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/6-2-project-instagram.jpg?w=768&amp;h=601 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/vishalicious213/6.2-React-Components-Insta-Clone/tree/vish-singh\">View code on GitHub</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>The project for our Composing React Components and Passing Data Via Props lesson was to &#8220;build a simple Instagram clone using React&#8221;.

React components</h2>\n<p>One of the keys to building out user interfaces with React is to create <strong>reusable components</strong>. These can be used in many areas of an application, as needed. Examples can include buttons, thumbnails, comment sections, and more.</p>\n<p>By making use of function components and passing props to them, props data can be rendered inside of JSX to customize otherwise generic components &#8211; like changing the name or color of a button, or the image for a thumbnail, or adding a new comment. This is often done using <strong>nested components</strong> which rely on props from a parent component to render part of a UI.</p>\n<p>A nested component is one that&#8217;s called from inside of another component. As stated, they often take in props from the parent component.</p>\n<pre>const Band = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;Napalm Death&lt;/h2&gt;\n      &lt;Album \n        album=\"Scum\" \n        year=\"1987\"\n        song=\"Multinational Corporations\" \n        lyric=\"Genocide of the starving nations\" \n      /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<pre>const Album = (props) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h3&gt;{props.album}, {props.year}&lt;/h3&gt;\n      &lt;img src={require('../img/'+`${props.album}`+'.jpg')} alt=`${props.album}`/&gt;\n      &lt;Song song={props.song} lyric={props.lyric} /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<pre>const Song = props =&gt;\n  return (\n    &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;{props.song}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;p&gt;{props.lyric}&lt;/p&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>I know the components above are a bit messy and could be broken into further child components, but they illustrate that Band has Album nested in it, and Album nests Song. Band passes four named props to Album, which renders two of them and passes the other two to Song, which finally, renders them. To illustrate an additional use of the &#8220;album&#8221; prop, I used it not only in an &lt;h3&gt; but also in a path to an image for an album cover, and as alt text for screenreaders. Its actually the same technique I used on the sprint challenge for this unit when I took it in WEBPT10, to render local images for Star Wars characters onscreen. Its recommended both at Lambda and in other sources, like React&#8217;s official documentation, not to drill deeper than 4 levels when passing props.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, passing props down to child components is how we can do things like create buttons that share the same style but different text, or image thumbnails that are formatted the same but show different pictures and link to different image files, and so on. Making them unique or dynamic also ties into the next section:</p>\n<h2>Passing props to a React component as dynamic data</h2>\n<p>So, the examples above and in my previous post relied on <strong>static data</strong> to work. The props in &lt;Album /&gt; were never going to change because they&#8217;re hard-coded. In order to change that, we need to pass <strong>dynamic data</strong> to our components. Dynamic data is simply data that can change. If I passed in information for different albums, whether I read them from a local array or from an external API, that data would now be dynamic, because its not hard-coded in my component. Basically, for each pass through the components, they would render something different: a new album.</p>\n<p>Right now, our component flow is Band -&gt; Album -&gt; Song. To make the whole application render different albums, or even different bands&#8217; catalogs dynamically, we could add a parent component to Band that is stateful and passes state data with band information in it to Band as props. Band would then send that props data further down the rabbit hole to its child components and render albums dynamically.</p>\n<p>Since we&#8217;re using function components and hooks, we start by importing the .useState() hook into the parent application.</p>\n<pre>import React, { useState } from 'react';</pre>\n<p>Next, we would use .useState() in our function component to create a slice of state, a function to update that state, and optionally, a starting value for state.</p>\n<pre>function App() {\n  const [band, setBand] = useState();\n\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt; className='App'&gt;\n      &lt;Band band={band} /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>Ok. I just did that thing that I hated, where I set props equal to a value with the same name as it (band={band}). Sadly, its the norm and I named &lt;Band /&gt;, &lt;Album /&gt; and &lt;Song /&gt; that way, too, above just to drill it into my own head as much as anyone else&#8217;s who reads this. Anyway, here are some details about the App() function:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>All React component functions needs to start with a capital letter.</li>\n<li>The filenames also need to start with a capital letter.</li>\n<li>&#8220;class&#8221; can&#8217;t be used in JSX. The equivalent is &#8220;className&#8221;. This is because &#8220;class&#8221; is a reserved word in JavaScript, so we can&#8217;t use the HTML attribute with the same name.</li>\n<li>&lt;Band band={band} /&gt; means call the component &#8220;Band&#8221; and pass it a prop called &#8220;band&#8221; with data from the slice of state called {band}. Apologies about that.\n<ol>\n<li>Think about that 2nd part more as something like bandInfoProps=bandState, if that makes more sense.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;d need to modify the &lt;Band /&gt; component to work with props from the &lt;App /&gt; component. And we&#8217;d need to read data for all of this into &lt;App /&gt; from somewhere, whether its a local array or an API from the wild. &lt;Band /&gt; could look something like this:</p>\n<pre>const Band = (props) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;{props.name}&lt;/h2&gt;\n          &lt;Album \n          album={props.album}\n          year={props.year}\n          song={props.album.song.title}\n          lyric={props.album.song.lyrics}\n        /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>My assumption is that in our data, each band would have an array of albums which would also have an array of songs and each song would have a title and lyrics. To use this in our application, we&#8217;d have to read that data from somewhere, set it to state and then state would pass it along as props and let the components do their thing. Getting that data could be something that we automatically do when the application launches (we can set an initial state with a particular band, album and song) or could happen when a user triggers it, like by clicking a button.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll look at this more in my recap about the next lesson, which will discuss side effects, .useEffect() hook and getting data from an API. Oh, and all of the components above would need to have the right imports and exports. &lt;Band /&gt;, &lt;Album /&gt; and &lt;Song /&gt; would probably use &#8220;export default&#8221; with their main functions and each parent component would import its child, so App() would import &#8220;Band&#8221; and &#8220;Band&#8221; would import &#8220;Album&#8221; and &#8220;Album&#8221; would import &#8220;Song&#8221;.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>text Building a user interface with React components One of the keys to building out user interfaces with React is to create reusable components.

we know, components are self-contained pieces of a program that perform a specific function. In React, components need to share <strong>state</strong>. This is often done using a helper object called <strong>props</strong>. JavaScript <strong>modules</strong> are the building blocks of React components. They&#8217;re individual files with their own code. Like <strong>closure</strong> and <strong>scope</strong>, they restrict the access of information, securing data from the rest of the given application. Code from a module can still be explicitly accessed by other modules, however, if they&#8217;re given permission to do so.</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>In its infancy, inserting JavaScript into a web application was done via a &lt;script&gt; tag inside of an HTML file.\n<ol>\n<li>These ran in sequence, from top to bottom.</li>\n<li>To reuse code, it had to be copied and pasted.</li>\n<li>Functions and variables were all in the global scope.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>The &lt;src&gt; attribute came along and added reusability, but was still sequentially executed and globally scoped.</li>\n<li>Sometime <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression#cite_note-15\">around 2006</a></strong>, developers used module patterns like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immediately_invoked_function_expression\"><strong>IIFE</strong></a> (Immediately Invoked Function Expression, or &#8220;iffy&#8221;).\n<ol>\n<li>These are JavaScript functions that run as soon as they&#8217;re defined.</li>\n<li>They provide privacy from global scope to inner variables.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Node.JS</strong> was released in 2009, allowing JavaScript to run outside of the browser.\n<ol>\n<li>CommonJS (a standard JS library) provided it with a standard for sending data to and from file systems.</li>\n<li>It relies on transpilers and 3rd-party bundlers like webpack, rollup and Babel, which all require downloading, configuring and updating.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Today, JavaScript modules (ECMAScript modules) provide native functionality to import and export functions, components and data from files via the <strong>import</strong> and <strong>export</strong> keywords.\n<ol>\n<li>No dependencies needed, its vanilla ES6</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>How To</h3>\n<p>Using modules in JavaScript (and by extension, React) is actually really simple. In a .js file with a function, component or data that you want to export, you choose what you want to export with the &#8220;export&#8221; keyword. Then, in the file that you want to use that function, component or data, you bring it in with the &#8220;import&#8221; keyword. That&#8217;s it.</p>\n<p>Here are examples:</p>\n<pre>export const someFunction = () =&gt; {\n  return something;\n}</pre>\n<p>The above exports someFunction. It can be in any .js file, like &#8220;someFunction.js&#8221;.</p>\n<pre>import { someFunction } from './someFunction.js';</pre>\n<p>That line imports someFunction into whatever other .js file we place it in. Imports are usually done at the top of the file where the import is happening.</p>\n<p>Maybe we have a file with more than one function in it that we want to export. We can do so like this:</p>\n<pre>export const somefunction = () =&gt; {return something};\nexport const someOtherFunction = () =&gt; {return another thing};\nexport const aThirdFunction = () =&gt; {return more stuff};</pre>\n<p>In the file with the functions we want to use, we export them all. Then, in the file in which we want to make use of those functions, we import them like this:</p>\n<pre>import { someFunction, someOtherFunction, aThirdFunction } from './someFunctions.js';</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s the basics of exporting functions from one file and importing them into another. There&#8217;s one last type of import/export. Its called a &#8220;<strong>default</strong>&#8221; export.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;export&#8221; allows a single named function to be imported into another module via the &#8220;import&#8221; keyword</li>\n<li>&#8220;export default&#8221; makes it so a given resource can be imported into another module by default and any other resources in that file need to be imported by name</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;<strong>Export default</strong>&#8221; can be done inline, like we did with the functions above, or at the end of the file (which is how I usually do it).</p>\n<pre>const exportMe = aVariable =&gt; {\n  return some amazing stuff;\n};\n\nexport default exportMe;</pre>\n<p>So, what does <em>export default</em> actually do on the importing file&#8217;s side? Basically, just this:</p>\n<pre>import { someFunction } from './someFunction.js';</pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s how we import a named function, normally.</p>\n<pre>import exportMe from './theFileItsIn.js';</pre>\n<p>So, the only real difference to my eyes, so far, is that we don&#8217;t need to put the function in curly braces to basically destructure it before import. I think its akin to something we&#8217;ve already used in projects:</p>\n<pre>import React from 'react';</pre>\n<p>And also:</p>\n<pre>import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';</pre>\n<p>React is probably exported by default from &#8216;react&#8217; and the hooks are probably named exports, hence the curlies. Also, to my understanding, we&#8217;re doing this without a file path using &#8216;react&#8217; the same way we would with other libraries like &#8216;axios&#8217; or &#8216;styled-components&#8217; because they&#8217;re installed libraries and are somehow tracked by the code editor or IDE. Its likely in an environment file or something.</p>\n<p>While we&#8217;re on the topic of file paths, here are some examples of path prefixes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>current directory: ./</li>\n<li>parent directory: ../</li>\n<li>parent of parent directory: ../../</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When importing from a file, we need to include the prefix, so that the file system can be navigated from a point-of-origin of the file that we&#8217;re loading to. So, for example, if you&#8217;re importing into a file called App.js and your component is in a folder, on the same level, called &#8220;components&#8221;, your path could look like this: &#8220;./components/filename.js&#8221;.</p>\n<h2>Props</h2>\n<p>Props are used to pass information held on state from inside of one component to another. They&#8217;re <strong>read-only</strong> &#8211; we don&#8217;t make changes to props data. This keeps the data-flow in an application from getting messy. It also reduces where data is changed in an application, so we know exactly which components are making changes and can troubleshoot with greater ease. Its a much smoother experience than hunting through an application with data changes in every file.</p>\n<h3>State and props management in components</h3>\n<p><strong>Stateful components</strong> hold state data. This data can be objects placed inside of constructor functions (the traditional method) or function components using the .useState hook (the new method). In a React application, state is either loaded and stored in a centralized component dedicated to state management or a component that renders other components using that state. If data is consumed by multiple components, its best to centralize it in state in a top-level component common to the consuming components.</p>\n<p>Components rendered by a stateful component can receive state as props. It can be sent using the <em>props object</em> to the consuming child component and looks like an HTML attribute. If changes need to be made to that data, the props data is not changed. Instead, updates are sent to the parent component that holds state, often using a called function. That state is then recirculated throughout the application.</p>\n<p>Consider these parent, child and grandchild components:</p>\n<pre>const BlackSabbath = () =&gt; {\n  const [member, setMember] = useState({name: 'Geezer Butler', role: 'bassist'});\n  return &lt;BandInfo member={member} /&gt;;\n}</pre>\n<pre>const BandInfo = (props) =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;ShowMember member=(props.member) /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<pre>const ShowMember = props =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h2&gt;{props.member.name} is the {props.member.role} for Black Sabbath.&lt;/h2&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>So, the parent component places an object with two key-value pairs in state as an initial value. Because its using .useState() we know its a function component, not a class component. It then sets a named prop to that value in JSX where it calls a React component called BandInfo.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;member&#8221; on the outside is the prop name. Its similar to an HTML/JSX attribute. The &#8220;member&#8221; inside of the curly braces is the value from state, so it has the object info. I&#8217;ve never liked it when the prop and the value its assigned use the same name. I find it confusing, but its a standard, because that data is referencing the same thing, even if the use is a little different for each (one is the data, the other is used to point to the data when it goes to another component).</p>\n<p>BandInfo receives the props from its parent component as an <strong>object argument</strong> then sends it off as another named prop to its own child component, ShowMember. Note that because it was received as props, its now prefaced with &#8220;props.&#8221; and then the named prop.</p>\n<p>ShowMember finally receives the props from BandInfo as an argument and returns a React element (JSX) in which it pulls out individual attributes from the object to render an &lt;h2&gt; onscreen. So, {user} is passed as {props.user} and then rendered with {props.user.name} and {props.user.role}. It uses props, the named props object, then the name of the attribute it needs to render.</p>\n<p>Yeah, that seemed like a convoluted mess to me, too. It still does, to an extent, but I understand it a little more now. I see how adding some code to BlackSabbath to feed it an array of band members can now render the whole band. If we modify it further, we can even send a band name and an array of members and display other bands in their entirety. Any one of those components could get data from a different source and thus be used in different applications, too.</p>\n<p>So that brings us to another question:</p>\n<h3>Why?</h3>\n<p>To answer this question, I&#8217;m going to quote directly from the Lambda text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"list-style-type:none;\">\n<ul>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Control.</strong> As we learned with modules, when we break our components down into smaller functions, we gain greater control over what we display and how it works. By keeping state in one of a few select components and passing as props, we minimize the risk of making unintended changes to our state data.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Readability.</strong> Separate files are easy to keep in order, and make it easier for other developers to read through our code, know where our state is held, and where it’s being sent. The easier your code is to read and understand, the more likely someone is to ask you write more it for them.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Maintenance.</strong> If we want to make changes, we can find components quickly, and working in files that only manage one or two different aspects of our application is a much easier task than scrolling through hundreds of lines of code! Also, this way, we can isolate any problems that come up and debug faster.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Reusability.</strong> This is huge! Now we have reusable components, and they can render any data that we pass through, so long as it matches to type on our object. And with a few modifications, we render additional data if we added to our object. Or we could even pass in an array of hundreds of objects and render the information contained on each one. This would only require a few additional lines of code.</p></blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ok. This is a lot again. I&#8217;m going to split this post into two halves, like my previous post. In the next, we&#8217;ll look at composing React components and passing props as dynamic data to a React component.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>JavaScript Modules As we know, components are self-contained pieces of a program that perform a specific function.

Project","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/31/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-project/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-qI","content":"<p>For our <strong>React Components and Component State</strong> lesson, we were tasked to &#8220;build a stateful component that renders a scoreboard and utilize the click listener on buttons to increment each team&#8217;s score&#8221;. We were given a link to a GitHub repository for &#8220;American Football Scoreboard&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This is actually my third time doing this project. I did it once, in WEB23, another time in WEBPT10 and finally, in WEBPT14. I was able to complete it, each time, but I&#8217;d definitely say my understanding of the process has improved with each new attempt.</p>\n<p>The main project description said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">In this project, you build an app that diplays a scoreboard for an american football game. There will be two buttons for each team &#8211; one will increment that team&#8217;s score by three points (for a &#8220;field goal&#8221;) and the other will increment that team&#8217;s score by seven points (for a &#8220;touchdown&#8221; and &#8220;extra point&#8221;). The css is already done for you. You should focus your efforts on the functionality of the app.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To complete the project, we had to import the <strong>useState</strong> hook, to give our function component access to state. Then, we had to make sure that team scores were saved to state and were being rendered onscreen from state. We could optionally set initial score values (I used 0) and then add functionality to buttons onscreen using <strong>onClick</strong> handlers to increment each team&#8217;s score by either 3 points (field goal) or 7 points (touchdown) depending on which of two buttons were clicked.</p>\n<p>The project focused expressly on our ability to update state, with an initial score value and then with the ability for the user to modify the score. The text and videos for this lesson were exceptionally long, but ultimately, this project is distilled into those two concepts: set initial state and update it.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://vish213-scoreboard-v3.netlify.com/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1662\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/31/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-project/6-1-project-football/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,538\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"6-1 project-football\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg?w=800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1662\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg\" alt=\"6-1 project-football\" width=\"800\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg 800w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg?w=300&amp;h=202 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/6-1-project-football.jpg?w=768&amp;h=516 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/vishalicious213/6.1-react-american-football-scoreboard-v3\">View code on GitHub</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>For our React Components and Component State lesson, we were tasked to &#8220;build a stateful component that renders a scoreboard and utilize the click listener on buttons to increment each team&#8217;s score&#8221;.

continues my review/recap of the first React lesson in Lambda School&#8217;s fullstack web developer track. You can find the first part <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/28/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-1-of-2/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Web applications are driven by <strong>state,</strong> which is the data needed to render components onscreen. As state changes, components update to reflect these changes. In the previous post, we looked at some examples of state &#8211; not code, but examples of state onscreen and what it could change, like status updates (posts), lists (groups and pages), images (ads) and smaller sections of an interface, such as the number of likes or dislikes on a post or video, a subscribe button with the number of subscriptions and even the state of an entire application based on whether a user is logged in or not.</p>\n<p>The Lambda text gave some real-world examples that weren&#8217;t computer-based. For example, a traffic light has three possible states: red, yellow or green. The simplest state is on and off, like a light bulb or any other binary/boolean. An application, like a to-do list, could potentially have a state of &#8220;three to-do&#8217;s, none of which are complete&#8221;. Completing one of the to-do&#8217;s changes the application&#8217;s state, as does turning a light on or off, or a traffic light changing from red to green.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1617\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/28/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-1-of-2/sprint-6-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1370,676\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sprint 6-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1617\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint 6-1\" width=\"1370\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg 1370w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=148 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=379 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=505 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px\" /></p>\n<h2>React Hooks</h2>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html\">&#8211; Components and Props, reactjs.org</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The traditional way of writing stateful React components was to use <strong>class components</strong>. These are like JavaScript classes and look like this:</p>\n<pre>class BigFour extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return &lt;p&gt;One of the Big Four of thrash metal is {this.props.band}&lt;/p&gt;\n  }\n}</pre>\n<p>Lambda actually didn&#8217;t begin teaching React to my cohort using class components. I think previous cohorts did start with it, however. When I started Lambda, <strong>React Hooks</strong> had just been introduced to the world. Hooks are a way of making function components <strong>stateful.</strong> They&#8217;re a simpler way to write components and were named because they allow function components to &#8220;hook into&#8221; React state and <strong>lifecycle features</strong>. Hooks don&#8217;t work in class components &#8211; they can only be used in function components, so state can be used without classes.</p>\n<p>This is the the hook equivalent of the class component above:</p>\n<pre>function BigFour(props) {\n  return &lt;p&gt;One of the Big Four of thrash metal is {props.band}&lt;/p&gt;\n}</pre>\n<p>As we can see, &#8220;class&#8221; has been replaced by &#8220;function&#8221;, we&#8217;re no longer extending React.Component, the render() method isn&#8217;t needed and &#8220;this&#8221; is no longer needed to bind props to the function. We also name &#8220;props&#8221; where the function takes in data, whereas in the class component we don&#8217;t do this &#8211; I think its automatically assumed that props would have to be brought in and bound to the class with &#8220;this&#8221;. Just doing away with worrying about &#8220;this&#8221; is a big improvement, to me. We&#8217;ll talk about props shortly.</p>\n<h2>Props and State</h2>\n<p>Function components can make use of the <strong>state hook</strong> to gain access to state. All hooks in React begin with the word &#8220;<strong>use</strong>&#8221; and then the name of something it provides access to. In this case, to use state, the hook is literally called &#8220;<strong>useState</strong>&#8220;. Its typically imported into a function component like this:</p>\n<pre>import React, { useState } from 'react';</pre>\n<p>Its imported from React inside of curly braces because its a single component from React. I&#8217;ve also imported it like this, with another hook, and its worked:</p>\n<pre>import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';</pre>\n<p>Once useState has been imported from React, the way its initialized and updated (usually right at the start of the function) looks like this:</p>\n<pre>const [name, setName] = useState();</pre>\n<p>Its a strange line, for people who are seeing it for the first time, but this is what it means:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>name is the name of the variable/piece of state</li>\n<li>setName is the name of a function that can update name</li>\n<li>useState() is the hook that lets the component use state to begin with</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Another example could be:</p>\n<pre>const [quantity, setQuantity] = useState();</pre>\n<p>In the above example , we have a quantity of some kind that can be updated by calling the setQuantity function. Its a common convention to name the function that can update state with the word &#8220;<strong>set</strong>&#8220;. We don&#8217;t have to do it, but its something that&#8217;s encouraged, and I haven&#8217;t seen anyone <em>not</em> use this format. So, &#8220;numberOfLikes&#8221; is updated by &#8220;setNumberOfLikes&#8221; and &#8220;favoriteBand&#8221; is updated by &#8220;setFavoriteBand&#8221; and so on.</p>\n<p>We can also specify an initial value for state inside of the parenthesis of the useState() hook. Consider these:</p>\n<pre>const [name, setName] = useState(''); // sets name to a blank string\nconst [name, setName] = useState('Takeshi Kovachs'); // sets name to Takeshi Kovachs\nconst [quantity, setQuantity] = useState(0); // sets quantity to 0\nconst [items, setItems] = useState([]); // sets items to an empty array</pre>\n<p>The setState function that we specify with the useState hook isn&#8217;t actually written by us anywhere in the application. Whatever we name it, its used by React to update the piece of state that its associated with, so the inner workings of that particular function is already defined by React.</p>\n<h3>Updating state</h3>\n<p>We can&#8217;t update state by directly assigning a new value to it.</p>\n<pre>name = 'Lews Therin Telamon Kinslayer'; // won't update the slice of state called \"name\".</pre>\n<p>Instead, somewhere in our code, when we want to update the slice of state called &#8220;name&#8221;, we have to use setName(), like this:</p>\n<pre>setName('Lews Therin Telamon Kinslayer'); // this WILL update state</pre>\n<p>So, &#8220;name&#8221; is a variable. Its a slice of state (which basically means a variable that&#8217;s held in state). We initialized its value as a blank string with &#8220;useState(&#8221;);&#8221; in an example above and as the main character from Altered Carbon with &#8220;useState(&#8216;Takeshi Kovachs&#8217;);&#8221; in another example. The function that can change its value is called &#8220;setName&#8221;.</p>\n<h3>Why is this important?</h3>\n<p>So, now, why is state important? What makes it different from just using a regular variable? I was confused about this at first, too, until I finally learned that updating state causes the rest of an application to render or re-render as needed. State is a centralized variable. If its used only in a single component, its called <strong>component state</strong>. If its used in more than one component, its called <strong>application state</strong>. Updating state causes the components which use it to render, so it gives us essentially a &#8220;single source of truth&#8221; for a given &#8220;variable&#8221;.</p>\n<p>React essentially &#8220;reacts&#8221; to state. State is what makes React render with up-to-date information.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s another important characteristic of state. Updating it changes it at the top level, where it was originally defined, then the new value filters down to any components that make use of that slice of state. In this way, all of an application is always working with the most current value for any given slice of state.</p>\n<p>So, while variables in JavaScript components might live inside of those components, state can actually be passed around a React application &#8211; passed down, from parent to child, really. If its updated, that update is sent to the top and recirculated to any components that use it (useState) and it causes them to re-render with new state.</p>\n<h3>Props</h3>\n<p>So, how do we actually pass state down from one component to another? We do it using <strong>props,</strong> which means &#8220;properties&#8221; and looks just like an HTML attribute. React components are called from inside of JSX. They look like self-closing HTML elements with proper names (capital letters). Using our BigFour component from way at the top of this post would look like this:</p>\n<pre>&lt;BigFour /&gt;</pre>\n<p>It would have to be inside of the return() statement in a React component, and if it wasn&#8217;t the only thing being returned, it would have to be nested inside of a container. Whenever you&#8217;re returning more than one element in JSX, they have to be inside of a container, so if BigFour were accompanied by a title, they&#8217;d have to be grouped like this:</p>\n<pre>return (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Thrash Metal&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n)</pre>\n<p>But, this alone wouldn&#8217;t tell us who any of the BigFour are. We can provide that information via props, which, as stated, look like HTML attributes. For example:</p>\n<pre>return (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Thrash Metal&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour band='Slayer' /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n)</pre>\n<p>We can even call the same component multiple times, if needed, like this:</p>\n<pre>return (\n  &lt;div&gt;\n    &lt;h1&gt;Thrash Metal&lt;/h1&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour band='Metallica' /&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour band='Megadeth' /&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour band='Slayer' /&gt;\n    &lt;BigFour band='Anthrax' /&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n)</pre>\n<p>The function itself, if you remember, takes in props, which can hold any number of variables in it, and in its return statement, it used {props.band} in curly braces to allow it to include JavaScript in its JSX/HTML, like this:</p>\n<pre>function BigFour(props) {\n  return &lt;p&gt;One of the Big Four of thrash metal is {props.band}&lt;/p&gt;\n}</pre>\n<p>We could conceivably even read in an array of the big four and map() through it and output the component once for each band in the array. But, the important thing here is that one component called another component, passed state data to it in the form of props and let that second component render using that data.</p>\n<p>When state is inside of a component and is being managed by a component, its called state. When it (or other variables) is passed from a parent component to a child component, its called props. Props from a parent component can even be used to set state on a child component. We&#8217;ll delve into this more in the next post.</p>\n<h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>\n<p>Conditional rendering is the process of rendering a component based on a condition &#8211; in the case of React, its generally based on state. If state is X then return something, or some component. If state is Y then return something else or a different component. It seems pretty straightforward, and it basically is. What caught me, when I refactored my portfolio from vanilla JavaScript to React, is that you can&#8217;t use if..else statements in JSX, even inside of curly braces. I don&#8217;t know the reason for this yet. What you <em>can</em> use in their place are <strong>ternary operators</strong> (essentially another incarnation of an if..else statement) or <strong>switch statements</strong>.</p>\n<pre>return (\n  {coinToss === 'heads' ? &lt;Heads /&gt; : &lt;Tails /&gt;}\n)</pre>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t used ternaries a lot yet, but I do need to get more accustomed to them. What we have above is a conditional that says that if a coin toss returns &#8220;heads&#8221; then render the &lt;Heads&gt; component, else render the &lt;Tails&gt; component.</p>\n<p>In my portfolio, I used switch statements coupled with an event listener (called an onClick in React) to render components based on a click. One of them (the one that switches between front-end, back-end and about-me components looked like this:</p>\n<pre>_renderSubComp(){\n    switch(this.state.render){\n        case 'frontend': return &lt;Frontend /&gt;\n        case 'backend': return &lt;Backend /&gt;\n        case 'about': return &lt;About /&gt;\n    }\n}</pre>\n<p>It was in a class component, which is why I have to bind state to &#8220;this&#8221; but the part we want to look at here is the switch(variable) and the case conditions, which tell the switch which component to render. These function components just pasted info onscreen. They didn&#8217;t need props to work, as their data is static.</p>\n<h3>Clicky clicky</h3>\n<p>So, since web applications are made up of state and things that change state, we need to look at one of the most important methods of changing state: user interaction. In this case, the <strong>onClick</strong> event &#8211; React&#8217;s click listener.</p>\n<p>onClick takes a callback function which it executes if the element its attached to is clicked. Especially when it comes to adjusting state, we can&#8217;t just assign state a new value with a click. It has to be in the form of a function, or it will turn into an infinite loop in which state is constantly being updated and rendered.</p>\n<pre>&lt;div onClick={ setQuantity(quantity + 1) } className=\"Count\"&gt; // infinite loop\n\n&lt;div onClick={ ()=&gt; setQuantity(quantity + 1) } className=\"Count\"&gt; // working function</pre>\n<p>One final note: last year, in a JavaScript post, I shared the &#8220;<strong>!</strong>&#8221; or what my first TL called the <strong>bang</strong>. It turns a variable or statement into its opposite, so true and !true are opposites. This can be used with a setState function that&#8217;s updating a boolean, to essentially switch its value to the opposite &#8211; so essentially its an on/off switch. In the code-along project in the Training Kit, it was used with a lightbulb application to change state from lightOn to !lightOn, so if the switch was on, it would turn off, and if it was off, it would turn on. Experiment with this, because its late for me and I&#8217;m done typing.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This post continues my review/recap of the first React lesson in Lambda School&#8217;s fullstack web developer track.

JavaScript library developed by Facebook to rapidly generate user interfaces. Its the most popular front-end JavaScript library in the world right now, and has been for some time. Previously, we learned how to build <strong>components</strong> with JavaScript that make use of separate HTML, CSS and JavaScript files to essentially build functions that output specific content onscreen. For example, a menu can be a component, or a carousel, or another specific part of a web page like a product list.</p>\n<p>This was all made possible by DOM manipulation, with syntax like document.getElementByClassname and so on. It can be a tedious process to build components in this manner, combining code from .js files, .html files and .css files to render a single part of a page. React simplifies this process by allowing a single file to contain both the logic necessary to work with data and perform user interactions on a page with the markup and styling needed to render it onscreen. It essentially takes the HTML, CSS and JavaScript and allows them to cohabitate a single file. By doing so, components become centralized, so they&#8217;re easier to manage. It also allows applications and components to call on other components, in exactly the same manner as imports and exports from JavaScript, which also simplifies the implementation of components and features in an application.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1617\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/28/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-6-react-components-and-component-state-1-of-2/sprint-6-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1370,676\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sprint 6-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1617\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint 6-1\" width=\"1370\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg 1370w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=74 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=148 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=379 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-6-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=505 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px\" /></p>\n<p>A key feature of React is the use of <strong>state</strong>, which is data that determines what is rendered onscreen. In complex user interfaces, like that of Facebook or YouTube or Twitter, there are many elements rendered onscreen onscreen. Facebook might have status updates, a component to post, a sidebar with groups and pages, a section with ads, and more. YouTube has a video, a section with comments, likes and dislikes, a subscription button, a sidebar with other videos, a sidebar with other channels and with controls pertinent to the logged-in user&#8217;s own channel and viewing history, and so on. All of these elements make use of current data, a.k.a. state.</p>\n<p>Being logged in or logged out changes the state of FB, Twitter or YouTube. It determines whether the use sees a register/login screen or has access to the user&#8217;s account. A friends list might be loaded into state, which determines what posts are onscreen in Facebook. Clicking on a group changes state to show a different set of posts and changes the location of where the current user is posting to. Adding a filter to a video search on YouTube changes the sort, which re-renders videos based on time and date uploaded; selecting a channel changes the state of the videos displayed onscreen to show only that channel&#8217;s videos. Clicking &#8220;playlists&#8221; further filters the videos and updates state to show only the given channel&#8217;s videos for a particular playlist, and so on.</p>\n<p>All of this rendering and re-rendering places a heavy burden on the DOM, which can affect page performance. This data is updated in real-time, with every click potentially every aspect of a page. React offloads a lot of this burden from the DOM by managing the state that applications rely on to render onscreen. It does this by way of an engine called the <strong>virtual DOM</strong>.</p>\n<p>The virtual DOM acts like an intermediary between the DOM and the data it needs to render a web page. It &#8220;reacts&#8221; to changes in state and lets the DOM know what needs to be updated on a page. However, instead of updating an entire page and having to <span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">request data from a server</span> <span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">across the internet to render a page anew each time there&#8217;s a change, the virtual DOM detects changes to a page&#8217;s state and then tells the DOM specifically which nodes have need to be updated, accordingly. This process is called <strong>reconciliation</strong>. The DOM then updates only those nodes, instead of refreshing the whole web page. It relieves a great deal of pressure from the DOM and makes rich, stateful applications possible.</span></p>\n<h2>Components</h2>\n<p>Components are the building blocks of React. There are several types of components, but they fall into two basic categories: <strong>stateful components</strong> and <strong>function components</strong>. As the name implies, stateful components hold state, and function components do not. Function components display state on the DOM but don&#8217;t manipulate it in any way.</p>\n<pre>import React from 'react';\n\nconst Metal = () =&gt; {\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;SLAYER!!!&lt;h1&gt;\n      &lt;img src='horns.jpg alt='hand making heavy metal horns gesture' /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>Above is an example of a React component. What&#8217;s interesting about it is that it appears to combine two different languages. The top looks like a JavaScript import and a function and the bottom looks like HTML, with a &lt;div&gt; and &lt;h1&gt; and &lt;img&gt;.</p>\n<p>The HTML is actually a language called <strong>JSX,</strong> or JavaScript Extension. It uses JavaScript to emulate HTML (its basically DOM manipulation, but with an interface that looks like HTML). Because its JavaScript under the hood, it can also include actual JavaScript &#8211; including variables and functions and the like.</p>\n<p>That said, React components are just JavaScript functions. Adding JSX to the mix makes writing code to render elements onscreen easier. Instead of the more convoluted DOM syntax that we used previously, we can essentially use HTML-like code to create page elements. We can use inline styling to style the JSX, or we can import CSS, or we can even use what&#8217;s referred to as CSS-in-JS libraries like <strong>Styled Components</strong> to include CSS inside of the given component. It took me some time to get used to this method of building, but now, I actually prefer it to the traditional separation of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>All of this means that application logic AND the code that renders it and styles it can live together, making self-contained components possible. This means that its also very easy to swap out components or reuse them in other applications.</p>\n<h2>JavaScript</h2>\n<p>To include JavaScript in JSX, we have to enclose it in curly braces. This can be any JavaScript, from a variable name, to an expression, to a function. Here&#8217;s an example related to the code from above:</p>\n<pre>import React from 'react';\n\nconst Metal = () =&gt; {\n  const band = 'SLAYER!!!';\n  return (\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      &lt;h1&gt;{band}&lt;h1&gt;\n      &lt;img src='horns.jpg alt='hand making heavy metal horns gesture' /&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  )\n}</pre>\n<p>The output is the same, but note that the &lt;h1&gt; now holds a variable instead of the text string that it had before. Using JavaScript inside of JSX is called <strong>escaping</strong>. To escape, we nest the JavaScript inside of the &#8220;HTML&#8221; and enclose it in curly braces. So, just like with DOM manipulation, we can use React to compute the content of our &#8220;HTML&#8221; instead of having it hard-coded inside of the tags. The syntax is much easier for us to write and follow though &#8211; and easier to edit!</p>\n<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>\n<p>Two major React design tenets that we learned about at Lambda are (1) the <strong>separation of concerns</strong> and (2) <strong>declarative programming</strong>.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;separation of concerns&#8221; is a design philosophy that states that each piece of code should do one and only one thing. Its meant to simplify functions and lead to cleaner code. It also helps with debugging, as a function with one specific purpose is much easier to understand than one that does a myriad of things. They&#8217;re easier to test as a result, too.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve heard of this design philosophy before, and my initial issue with React&#8217;s implementation of it was that to me, having distinct HTML, CSS and JS files <em>was</em> an implementation of the philosophy. We were isolating the markup, the styles and the logic from each other. The React team had a different interpretation, however. As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">They argue that we can’t <em>truly</em> separate a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">&lt;button&gt;</code> tag from the function the button invokes. Separating the two, one in an HTML file and another in a JavaScript file, isn’t a separation of concerns, it’s cutting one concern in half and then putting one half in the bedroom and the other half in the garage. It’s a headache we don’t need.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At first, wrapping my head around this in a practical way was difficult. I understood the theory that was proposed, but writing React was just alien to my way of thinking, especially after the feelings of accomplishment of actually learning DOM manipulation. Later on, however, as I worked on more React applications, I began to appreciate this way of thinking more. Managing props and state and knowing where I can and can&#8217;t place JavaScript in a component that includes JSX was frustrating, but with time, its become more of a default to me. The syntax is much more straightforward than the JavaScript I was using to affect the DOM, thanks to JSX, and with the use of Styled Components, I have access to everything &#8211; page elements, styles and logic &#8211; all from one place.</p>\n<p>I love that I can use JavaScript in JSX. It makes more sense to me now, when I look at what I write, to have a function that iterates over data (like .map) and include its output inside of JSX. In many projects now, I&#8217;ve mapped over data from an API and returned JSX for each item in the array. Even though my JavaScript isn&#8217;t strong yet, React has helped me to make it a little hardier.</p>\n<p>The second design tenet is the idea of <strong>imperative programming</strong> vs. declarative programming. Imperative programming is what we&#8217;ve been using with our JavaScript to date. Its an explicit way of coding, but it can be difficult to write and lead to code that&#8217;s harder to understand. Declarative programming, which is the type that React employs, tells a computer <em>what</em> we want it to do, not necessarily <em>how</em> we want it done in detail.</p>\n<p>The example we were given to look at dealt with doubling an array. Using an imperative approach, we might have code that looks like this:</p>\n<pre>let numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];\n\nfor (i = 0; i &lt; numbers.length; i++) {\n  numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2;\n}</pre>\n<p>A declarative approach, on the other hand, could look like this:</p>\n<pre>const double = number =&gt; number * 2;\n\nnumbers.map(double);</pre>\n<p>While there&#8217;s nothing wrong with the first approach, I think that the second approach is easier to follow. We have a function that multiplies a number by 2. We use that function to map through an array. The imperative example goes through a lot more setup.</p>\n<p>The Lambda text does inform us that at lower levels, all code is imperative; but also says that with practice, declarative code is easier for us to read. The importance of this comes in the workplace, where, apparently, we&#8217;ll spend more of our time reading other people&#8217;s code and trying to understand it than we will writing our own code.</p>\n<p>Ok. I&#8217;m breaking from this for a bit. This first React lesson goes through a lot, and we haven&#8217;t dug into state just yet. I&#8217;m going to split this post into two parts and cover that in the next one.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook to rapidly generate user interfaces.

Challenge","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/26/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-applied-javascript-challenge/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-pP","content":"<p>I&#8217;m behind with my writing, but I&#8217;m getting close to catching up to where we currently are in the curriculum at Lambda. So, this one is about the Challenge for the first Sprint in Unit 2: Applied JavaScript. I actually did this twice. I completed it once in WEB23 and a second time in WEBPT10. Both times, I scored a 2, which means that I met MVP. I didn&#8217;t complete any stretch goals to push it to a 3, but I demonstrated my understanding of the DOM, DOM Events, Components, HTTP GET requests, and the axios library.</p>\n<p>The Challenge was called Lambda Times and it emulated the front page of an online newspaper. If I remember correctly, we had to grab data from an API at Lambda, which consisted of article information, then we had to iterate through the data and render it onscreen. The data was just a title, author and author image. There weren&#8217;t actual articles to link to behind anything.</p>\n<p>The first time I did it, I had a hard time pointing to the right parts of the data. It was an array of objects, with nested elements, of course. That&#8217;s something that&#8217;s intimidated me for a while, but I&#8217;ve finally gotten familiar enough with snaking through nested data that I can do it pretty reliably. It lends credence to the idea I&#8217;ve heard from other people at Lambda that even though we&#8217;re able to complete projects and pass Sprint Challenges, sometimes understanding doesn&#8217;t happen until later on. Regardless, the second go at it was definitely smoother.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1613\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/26/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-applied-javascript-challenge/sprint-challenge-applied-js/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1254,1252\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Sprint Challenge &#8211; Applied JS\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1613\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg\" alt=\"Sprint Challenge - Applied JS\" width=\"1254\" height=\"1252\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg 1254w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=768&amp;h=767 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/sprint-challenge-applied-js.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=1022 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1254px) 100vw, 1254px\" /></p>\n<p>I was looking at my student dashboard to see what my TLs said about each run, and the feedback was pretty different for each. For the first run, my WEB23 TL highlighted that the cards had been rendered programmatically (which was difficult for more than one person in my original cohort). He pointed out that I needed to focus on knowing the output from Object.Keys or knowing the process of looping through something, and in this case, using for&#8230;in to access the nested articles.</p>\n<p>My 2nd TL, from WEBPT10, commented that I&#8217;d done great in completing the challenge and that I had a good grasp of axios and JavaScript components. He suggested that I try to do the stretch goal, which was to implement a carousel. I didn&#8217;t know enough to do it then, but if there&#8217;s time during this hiatus, I might attempt it now (and I might also use lorem ipsum text to generate articles to link to). I remember at that time, I&#8217;d gotten used to axios and I&#8217;d also begun rewriting my portfolio and using JavaScript components to display different parts of it, instead of having individual pages for everything, so I was actually using what we&#8217;d learned in a personal project.</p>\n<p>Looking back at it now, I can see how the DOM and JS component lessons transfer directly to React, which has been my main focus as of late. Its interesting to see how performing basically the same types of tasks in vanilla JavaScript and with React contrast. Its also interesting to see how the implementation of each differs (with React&#8217;s components incorporating so many more technologies like JS, JSX and additional libraries) as a norm compared to plain JavaScript just being coupled with axios and having to reach outside for HTML and CSS to complete the same tasks. The process is definitely more streamlined in React, although initially, it was completely alien to my way of thinking.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://vishalicious213.github.io/5.5-Sprint-Challenge-Applied-Javascript-v2/\">Netlify: Sprint Challenge IV: Applied JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m behind with my writing, but I&#8217;m getting close to catching up to where we currently are in the curriculum at Lambda.

methods in which data can be requested from a server. This is a big part of web applications. At work, our clinical EMR made use of technology like this to communicate with pharmacy programs, laboratory programs, financial programs, hospitals and even other EMRs to exchange data. The main point of it was that if data was entered in one program, the user wouldn&#8217;t need to re-enter it in another one and risk human error with important clinical and medical information. It also allowed data from one program to power another, so for example, admission data from our program could be used to run financial reports in another one. With hospitals, it allowed key portions of the resident&#8217;s health record to travel from our nursing home clients to hospitals so that doctors at the hospitals had access to medical histories and to information that explained why a resident was being hospitalized, and what medical services might need to be provided.</p>\n<h2>Asynchronous code</h2>\n<p><strong>Asynchronous</strong> code is code that is not sequentially run, from line 1 to the last line in the program (or component). Its code that might need to wait for a response of some sort &#8211; especially in the case of code that asks for data to be transmitted back to it from somewhere else on the internet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/11_async.html\">Elegant JavaScript: Asynchronous Programming</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Promises</h2>\n<p><strong>Promises</strong> essentially queue up a response for code execution after a request of some sort. With regular, synchronous code, everything executes sequentially. However, if we have a piece of code whose execution is dependent on something, like outside data, then promises can come into play.</p>\n<p>The promise allows code to continue on while waiting for data to arrive. Once that data has arrived, the promise executes a callback. A callback can be specified for if the data was successfully retrieved, and a different callback can be specified for if the data request failed.</p>\n<p>As per MDN, promises exist in three states:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>pending</em>: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</li>\n<li><em>fulfilled</em>: meaning that the operation completed successfully.</li>\n<li><em>rejected</em>: meaning that the operation failed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are two main methods that are used to handle a promise: <strong>then</strong> and <strong>catch</strong>. If a request is successful, the &#8220;then&#8221; callback is run. If it fails, the &#8220;catch&#8221; callback is run. On a basic level, that&#8217;s all there is to it.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">If the promise succeeds, it will return the value as a parameter into a callback passed into <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.then()</code>. If the promise fails, the callback passed into the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.catch()</code> runs, taking an error as its argument.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If a promise gets a successful response, multiple then methods can also be run. This is called chaining promises. It basically looks like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"brush: js line-numbers language-js\"><code class=\" language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> iNeedThisDone <span class=\"token operator\">=</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Promise</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(runThisAndGetAResponse</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(doThisIfSuccessful</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>doThisIfSuccessfulToo<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>andDoThisAsWell<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">catch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>nowWeHaveToWorkOnTheWeekend<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n<p>So, if the new promise runs and is successful, it then runs three callback functions with the response that it received. If it fails and there&#8217;s no response, the catch method is run and someone&#8217;s weekend is ruined.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/promises\">JavaScript Promises: an Introduction</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">MDN: Promise &#8211; JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises\">MDN: Using Promises &#8211; JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://javascript.info/promise-basics\">JavaScript.info: Promise</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>HTTP</h2>\n<p><strong>HTTP,</strong> or HyperText Transfer Protocol, is a set of rules that specify how web browsers and web servers communicate, both on the internet and local networks. At work, I had to know a little about HTTP and some other protocols &#8211; especially those related to email (SMTP, POP3, IMAP) and I&#8217;ve read a little about FTP, or File Transfer Protocol, which is a set of rules about doing exactly what the name says.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, when browsing the internet, we actually see HTTPS about as often as HTTP. Its a secure version of HTTP that helps to anonymize and protect data as it travels from one computer through a network to another.</p>\n<p>Developers, apparently, need to understand what HTTP methods are, particularly those related to <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete\">CRUD</a></strong> operations &#8211; these are operations that Create, Read, Update and Delete data from other computers, generally servers. There are specific HTTP status codes associated with these operations. Almost everyone online has run into a 404 error, for example, when a web page won&#8217;t load.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">HTTP Methods</code> provide a common <em>language</em> or nomenclature that the client can use to let the server know what operation it wants to perform.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">When a client needs to ask a server for information it should do a GET request specifying a URL that points to the desired resource.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">A POST request is used to ask the server to add or <em>create</em> new resources.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">The method used by the client to ask the server to make changes to specific resources is PUT.</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\">To remove or delete data from the server the client needs to send a DELETE request.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">HTTP Status Codes</code> are used to indicate if a <em>request</em> has been successful or not and <strong>why</strong>. The server will set the status code for all responses sent to the client.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.restapitutorial.com/httpstatuscodes.html\">HTTP Status Codes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>axios</h2>\n<p><strong>axios</strong> (its all lowercase) is a JavaScript library that&#8217;s used to send HTTP requests to servers. Its easy to use, and under the hood it uses promises, because all server requests are asynchronous. To date, all of the projects that I&#8217;ve done that need data from an external API have used axios to get that data, except for one from a YouTube tutorial that used <strong><a href=\"https://javascript.info/async-await\">async/await</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>axios isn&#8217;t necessary to use for data transfer, but its syntax is relatively simple, so its a very popular library. The little experience I had with async/await was also pleasant. It was a fairly simple format to use as well.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also only really used the .get method in axios, which is apparently an implementation of the HTTP GET request, or the &#8220;R&#8221; in CRUD (Read). It sends out a request to a server or API asking for data.</p>\n<p>To use axios, we need to install it. The Lambda text says to include the following in the head section of our HTML file, which basically downloads axios and lets us use it in the associated JavaScript file:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nt\">&lt;script </span><span class=\"na\">src=</span><span class=\"s\">\"https://unpkg.com/axios/dist/axios.min.js\"</span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre>\n<p>With the exception of two projects, I don&#8217;t remember doing this, however. When I checked even my earlier projects using axios, it looks like I installed it (per project, not just once) in the console (Git BASH) with the following command:</p>\n<pre>npm install axios</pre>\n<p>Using Yarn, its done like this:</p>\n<pre>yarn add axios</pre>\n<p>In my projects, then I imported it like any other JavaScript library by adding this line at the top of the given component:</p>\n<pre>import axios from 'axios';</pre>\n<p>With axios installed and imported, we can use it to request data from an API. Generally, I&#8217;ve done that when an application loads, or when a component that needed external data loads. axios calls can be linked to other things though, like clicking a button or other user interactions.</p>\n<p>axios takes a string as its first argument. This is the URL of the resource we&#8217;re requesting. It then returns a promise to us, which means that its getting the data. As with all promises, .get and .catch deal with the results of the request.</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"nx\">axios</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"kd\">get</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"s1\">http://serverlocation.com/data</span><span class=\"dl\">'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">then</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"nx\">response</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// deal with the response data in here</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">})</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"k\">catch</span><span class=\"p\">(</span> <span class=\"nx\">err</span> <span class=\"o\">=&gt;</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n        <span class=\"c1\">// deal with the error in here</span>\n    <span class=\"p\">})</span></code></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/axios/axios\">GitHub: axios</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Get data and create dynamic components</h2>\n<p>With the knowledge gained from this unit (the DOM lessons and Components lessons) we now have access to everything we need to connect to an external source, get data from it and iterate over that data to render dynamic components.</p>\n<p>Using JavaScript, the steps we need to take to do this are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Build a component function</li>\n<li>Request dynamic data from a server</li>\n<li>Build components based on that data</li>\n<li>Add those components to the DOM</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Its important to remember that data that we receive from an outside server will follow its own format. This will be different for every server. Its a good idea to read the documentation for the server we&#8217;re connecting to, or to look at the data itself and learn its format before we try to use it. I generally get arrays of objects, and some of those objects have nested arrays in them, or even other objects. Its also important to identify a unique piece of data that can be used as a key, to distinguish each item in the data from the rest. Sometimes, we&#8217;re given an index that we can use for this.
