Now, we will look at how to pass data to a function.</p>\n<h3>Passing Data into Functions</h3>\n<p>A major reason to use functions is for code reuse. To accommodate this, functions allow data to be passed to them for use inside of the function. By doing so, the same code can be used over with different variables or data. Function variables are called <strong>parameters</strong> and are used to pass data to the function when its called. Once inside of the function, they&#8217;re called <strong>arguments.</strong></p>\n<h4>Parameters</h4>\n<p>Parameters are the names listed in the parenthesis when a function is declared. They accept and hold data to be used inside of a function. Arguments are the <em>actual values</em> passed to (and received by) the function, so essentially one is the variable and the other is the actual data in the variable.</p>\n<p>Parameters are defined when a function is created by naming each parameter inside of the parenthesis following the function&#8217;s name. They are separated by commas, and their data types are not specified.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>A function parameter will represent the data we pass into a function, for use in the function. Essentially when we write a function we assign the data variable names, even without knowing what the data will be. We set these variables inside of the parentheses when we write the function. There is no limit to the amount of parameters we can include in a function, but each variable name must be separated by a comma. We can then use these variables within our function just as we would any other variable.</em></p>\n<pre>function myFunc( parameter1, parameter2 ){\n// We can use parameter1 and parameter2 in this function just like a variable.\n}</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Function Parameters</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Arguments</h4>\n<p>Arguments are objects that are built into the function. They are passed to a function by value, so the function knows the <em>contents</em> of an argument, but doesn&#8217;t know where that data came from. If a function changes an argument&#8217;s value, it does not change the original parameter&#8217;s value; so changes are local to the function, not global to the entire program.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Once we have our parameters set up in our function, we can now pass data into the function. In order to do this, we will use the parentheses we write when we call the function. We call these pieces of data arguments. arguments can be ANY data type (string, number, Boolean, object, array, even other functions!). Unlike other languages, JavaScript does not require us to set the data type when we write the function, although you should make an effort to understand what type of data will be coming into the function (and if you are using pre-built functions, you should know what data type that function expects).</em></p>\n<p>To use an argument, simply put the argument&#8217;s data in the function call parentheses:</p>\n<pre>function logsName(name){ console.log(name); }\n\nlogsName(‘Vish’) // console.logs: Vish\nlogsName(‘Godzilla’) // console.logs: Godzilla</pre>\n<p>Multiple parameters require the use of more than one argument:</p>\n<pre>function logsArtist( artist, descriptor ){\nconsole.log(${artist} ${descriptor}`);\n}\n\nlogsArtist(‘Chuck Shuldiner’, ‘is the godfather of death metal!’)\n// console.logs: Chuck Shuldiner is the godfather of death metal!</pre>\n<p>Arguments line up with parameters in order, so the first argument gets data from the first parameter, and so on. If an argument is not given for a parameter, the parameter will be equal to <em>undefined.</em></p>\n<p>The recommended way to skip entering data for a given parameter, according to <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8356227/skipping-optional-function-parameters-in-javascript\"><strong>Stack Overflow</strong></a>, is to pass the value &#8220;undefined&#8221; to the function when calling it. This is essentially the same as the default parameter, as per the <strong>Function parameters</strong> section of this <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions\"><strong>Mozilla Developer Network</strong></a> article.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://codeburst.io/parameters-arguments-in-javascript-eb1d8bd0ef04\">Medium.com: Parameters &amp; Arguments in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwwXFl7QHDw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

FAANG is an acronym for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. They&#8217;re top-tier companies for developers to get hired to for their pay and perks, but apparently people get burned out at them relatively quickly. I think new developers and software engineers tend to last like 2.5 years or so before moving on to other companies. We know 3 people in our circle who work at FB and Google and have been there for more than 3 years, so its not necessarily the pre-ordained destiny for new hires, though.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <strong>TechLead</strong> is someone I&#8217;ve been following for a while. His humor is deadpan, and its sometimes hard to tell when he&#8217;s being serious or not, but when he actually produces an informative video, its good. In case you haven&#8217;t heard, he&#8217;s an ex-Google tech lead&#8230;</p>\n<p><strong>Clement Mihailescu</strong> is also an ex-Google software engineer. This was my first time seeing his channel, but it looks promising. Their collaboration provided some interesting details about people&#8217;s ideas of what working at a FAANG is like, compared to the reality of working at one.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s Part 1, from (the only) TechLead:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9f2-gfE58RE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>And here&#8217;s Part 2, from Clement:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pfQ2xAMR2hg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Finally, congrats to my brother and his wife on the birth of their first kid yesterday!

They can optionally take arguments (parameters), which are values that are passed to the function to be processed. They can also optionally return a value back.</p>\n<p>Although they&#8217;re generally used to define code that can be called multiple times (to reduce having to rewrite that same code repeatedly), book 1 of <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/up%20%26%20going\">You Don&#8217;t Know JS</a></strong> offers another tip: they can also be used to organize related bits of code into named collections. I like sorting items and placing the ones that are alike together, so this tip is right up my alley. 😉</p>\n<p>Functions adhere to a school of thought in programming called <strong>DRY,</strong> or Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself. It helps lead to lean code. They also have their own <strong>scope,</strong> so variables assigned within a function are not available outside of the function &#8211; although they can make use of global variables.</p>\n<h4>How to Write a Function</h4>\n<p>There are three ways to build a function. The pre-course focuses on the first one. The other two variations have their own uses and behaviors and are covered in later lessons.</p>\n<pre>function myFunc() {}\n\nconst anotherFunc = function () {};\n\nconst yetAnother = () =&gt; {};</pre>\n<h4>Anatomy of a Function</h4>\n<pre>function myFunc() {}</pre>\n<p>A function begins with the <strong>function</strong> keyword. This is called <strong>defining</strong> or <strong>declaring</strong> a function, and tells the computer that the code to follow is part of a function block. Next comes the name of the function. The name should describe what the function does. Then comes an opening and closing parenthesis, and finally opening and closing brackets. The actual code for the function will be placed between the brackets.</p>\n<pre>function logsHello() { console.log(‘hello’); }\n\nlogsHello();</pre>\n<p>In the above example, a function called logsHello is declared. Its only line of code instructs it to console.log the word <em>hello.</em> In order to run a function, it needs to be called with its name and a set of parenthesis. This is the standard syntax to run a function. The parenthesis allow data, such as variables, to be sent to the function so it can perform operations on them. The above example does not send any data to the function, however, as its only purpose is to say hello via the console.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_BYHsTVyZg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

If so, they need to be separated out, and the video that&#8217;s supposed to go over the <em>Learn to use different operators</em> material should be included.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve noticed spelling errors in the pre-course and awkward question phrasing in a lot of the JavaScript exercises on repl.it. Adding this to the mix does make me feel a little less-confident about the program. I think that they should conduct more quality control on their material.</p>\n<p>In the HTML/CSS lessons on CodePen. there was an option to leave feedback (there isn&#8217;t such a function on the repl.it lessons). I left a few messages there about spelling errors.

Each time a loop repeats, its called an <strong>iteration.</strong></p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Most software runs on loops, evaluating expressions over and over again until it either returns what we are looking for, or stops after a certain time. JavaScript has two looping expressions built into it and today we will look at the first one, the “for” loop.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript for loop</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>for Loops</h4>\n<p>The syntax for a for loop is more complex than that of an if statement. Its set up with the for keyword, parenthesis and open and close braces ( <em>for (loop condition code) {action code}</em> ). Inside of the parenthesis are three items, each separated by a semicolon:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>a declared variable to loop over</li>\n<li>a conditional expression that stops the loop upon becoming false</li>\n<li>a variable incrementer</li>\n</ol>\n<pre>for (let i = 0 ; i &lt; 10 ; i++ ) {console.log(i);}\n// | declare a var | conditional expression | increment var|</pre>\n<p>In the above example, the counter variable is initially set to 0. The loop will run and increment the counter by one as it completes each iteration. It will also evaluate the conditional expression during each iteration. If the expression remains true, it will run again, but if it becomes false, the loop will stop running.</p>\n<h4>The ++ operator</h4>\n<p>The <strong>++</strong> operator is JavaScript shorthand to add 1 to the current value of the given variable. I came across its counterpart online &#8211; the <strong>&#8212;</strong> operator, which subtracts 1 from the value of the given variable, so one is an <em>incrementer</em> and the other is a <em>decrementer.</em></p>\n<h4>Infinite Loops</h4>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_loop\"><strong>infinite loop</strong></a> is a loop that never stops, because because it has no terminating clause or has one that&#8217;s impossible to meet. For example:</p>\n<pre>for (let i = 0; i &gt;= 0; i++) {console.log(i);}</pre>\n<p>Because the above conditional expression will ALWAYS be true (it will never be less than 0) this loop will run forever. This can break the program and even crash the web browser or computer.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2poVk0UJdHY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

last night, I asked the <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/\"><strong>r/learnjavascript</strong></a> subreddit a question that&#8217;s been on my mind for a few days: <em>What are some key JS concepts a developer should know at the start of their career, and does this change over time/with seniority?</em> I received some interesting answers so far, and I&#8217;m hoping for more still.</p>\n<p>Information about arrays came up more than once, which seems to gel with the questions I was getting during the Lambda Challenge. There was also a series of books recommended, called <strong>You Don&#8217;t Know JavaScript</strong>. I actually came across these a few days ago &#8211; I can&#8217;t remember if it was on the Lambda Stack or if it was somewhere else online.

Its</span><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\"> fairly short &#8211; I think there are only about 50 pages of text, if you discount the preview/summaries of the rest of the series at the end. It gives basic information about programming and JavaScript concepts for those of us who are new to programming, which I essentially am after 20+ years of not writing code (and never in what&#8217;s looked at as a &#8220;modern&#8221; language at all). The rest of the series are deep dives into JS concepts that are often skirted by other writers due to their complexity. I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll be ready for them for a while, but they cover topics that were explicitly mentioned in responses to my inquiry on Reddit.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20%26%20going/toc.md\">Here&#8217;s the table of contents for the first book</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The entire series includes the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/up%20&amp;%20going/README.md#you-dont-know-js-up--going\">&#8220;Up &amp; Going&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/1993212/you-don-t-know-js-up-going/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/scope%20&amp;%20closures/README.md#you-dont-know-js-scope--closures\">&#8220;Scope &amp; Closures&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/1647631/you-don-t-know-js-scope-closures/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20&amp;%20object%20prototypes/README.md#you-dont-know-js-this--object-prototypes\">&#8220;this &amp; Object Prototypes&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/1734321/you-don-t-know-js-this-object-prototypes/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/types%20&amp;%20grammar/README.md#you-dont-know-js-types--grammar\">&#8220;Types &amp; Grammar&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/1935541/you-don-t-know-js-types-grammar/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/async%20&amp;%20performance/README.md#you-dont-know-js-async--performance\">&#8220;Async &amp; Performance&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/1977375/you-don-t-know-js-async-performance/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n<li>Read online (free!): <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/es6%20&amp;%20beyond/README.md#you-dont-know-js-es6--beyond\">&#8220;ES6 &amp; Beyond&#8221;</a>, Published: <a href=\"http://www.ebooks.com/2481820/you-don-t-know-js-es6-beyond/simpson-kyle/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Buy Now</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"282\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/24/reddit-what-are-some-key-js-concepts-a-developer-should-know-at-the-start-of-their-career-and-does-this-change-over-time-with-seniority/attachment/33/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"500,500\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"33\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg?w=500\" class=\"alignleft  wp-image-282\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg?w=50&#038;h=50\" alt=\"33\" width=\"50\" height=\"50\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg?w=50 50w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/33.jpg?w=100 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 50px) 100vw, 50px\" />Another excellent response included a GitHub collection of resources related to an article called <a href=\"https://github.com/leonardomso/33-js-concepts\"><strong>33 Concepts Every JavaScript Developer Should Know</strong></a>.

topics:</p>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Basic JS competency:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">array methods (for loops for everything don&#8217;t usually cut the mustard)</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">XHR requests (and how to effectively work with things like REST APIs in the browser)</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">DOM manipulation with vanilla JS and/or jQuery (and probably at least one framework)</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">event handlers and event delegation</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">best practices like when to use const over let</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">the differences between arrow functions and regular functions</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">asynchronous JS / promises (async/await nice to have) and error handling</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\"><strong class=\"_12FoOEddL7j_RgMQN0SNeU\">Slightly more advanced expectations:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">closures, scoping, and execution context</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">design patterns vs. anti-patterns</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">higher order functions / functions as &#8220;first-class citizens&#8221;</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">prototypal inheritance (not just I made an ES6 class, but have no idea how they really work)</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">an understanding of the call stack, event loop, etc.</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">able to produce a clear and concise explanation when asked to explain the meaning of <code class=\"_34q3PgLsx9zIU5BiSOjFoM\">this</code></li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">understanding the difference between browser APIs vs. a core JS language feature</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">up to date knowledge of newer language features like spread operators, destructuring, etc</li>\n<li class=\"_1qeIAgB0cPwnLhDF9XSiJM\">some grasp of tooling like webpack, eslint, babel, module loaders, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have a lot of research ahead of me. This list could keep me busy for years, but that first book in the You Don&#8217;t Know JavaScript series looks like a good place to start.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, last night, I asked the r/learnjavascript subreddit a question that&#8217;s been on my mind for a few days: What are some key JS concepts a developer should know at the start of their career, and does this change over time/with seniority? I received some interesting answers so far, and I&#8217;m hoping for more still.

It evaluates an expression and introduces <strong>branching</strong> to a program, allowing it to perform different tasks based on user input. Conditionals rely on the evaluation of expressions using logical operators to perform comparisons. They either act on specific values (including true/false), values in a given range or by the absence of a value (a default, usually at the end of the conditional, preceded by an <strong>else</strong> statement).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Nearly every programming language has process in which we use to tell our programs where to start, what to have happen when the process starts and when that process should end. Luckily in JavaScript this ability is baked right into to core foundation of the language without having to worry too much about managing things like memory on our computers etc. This lesson takes us through some basic techniques on how to tell our computers what to do, based on conditions with which we provide it.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Logical Operators</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Logical operators are reserved symbols (or words) that compare two or more pieces of information &#8211; usually expressions. They generally are used to test whether the expression is true or false (Boolean expressions). Just like truth tables in high school math, expressions can be evaluated using logical operators to see if either is true, both are true or neither is true.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&amp;&amp; (AND)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp; “AND” operator is written with two ampersands (<strong>&amp;&amp;</strong>). It evaluates two expressions and will return true if <strong>BOTH</strong> expressions are true. If <strong>EITHER</strong> expression (or both of them) is false, then this operator will return false:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (100 &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; 10 === 10) { \n  console.log(‘Both statements are true, so this code will be run’); \n} \n\nif (10 === 9 &amp;&amp; 10 &gt; 9) { \n  console.log('One of the statements is false, so the &amp;&amp; will return false, this code will not be run'); \n}</pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">|| (OR)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The “OR” operator is written with two vertical bars (<strong>||</strong>). It evaluates two expressions and will return true if <strong>ONE</strong>&nbsp;or <strong>BOTH</strong>&nbsp;of the expressions is true. It will return false if <strong>BOTH</strong> expressions are false:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (100 &gt; 10 || 10 === 10) { \n  console.log(‘Both statements are true’); \n  console.log('This code will be run.'); \n} \n\nif (10 === 9 || 10 &gt; 9) { \n  console.log('One of the statements is true so the || will return true'); \n  console.log('This code will be run.'); \n} \n\nif (10 === 9 || 1 &gt; 9) { \n  console.log('Both of the statements are false, so the || will return false. ');\n  console.log('This code will not be run.'); \n}</pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">! (NOT)</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The “NOT” operator is written as a single exclamation mark (<strong>!</strong>). It will return the <strong>opposite Boolean</strong> value of what is passed to it:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (!false) { \nconsole.log(‘The ! will return true because it is the opposite of false.’); \nconsole.log('This code will be run.'); \n} \n\nif (!(1 === 1)) { \nconsole.log('1 does equal 1, that expression returns true. The ! operator will then return the opposite of that.'); \nconsole. log('This code will not be run.'); \n}</pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Notes About Logical Operators</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The expressions are evaluated in order, and the computer will skip any redundant expressions. In an &amp;&amp; statement, if the first expression is false, the second expression will not be evaluated because BOTH expressions need to be true. Same for the || statement. If the first expression is true, the second will not be evaluated because there only needs to be one true statement to fulfill the requirements of the operator.</em><br><em>Use parentheses. As we saw in the second ! operator example, we used parentheses to evaluate what was inside of the parentheses FIRST, then applied the ! operator. We can wrap ANY expression in parentheses and it will be evaluated before evaluating the expression as a whole.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Control Flow (continued)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We can use the <strong>if statement</strong> to check and see if an expression is true. If it is, a set of code can be executed. If it is not, that code can be skipped and the program can continue to run.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (1 + 1 === 2) { console.log('The expression is true!'); }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>else if</strong> and <strong>else</strong> statements expand on the base if statement. These statements can only be used with if and must come after it. They are evaluated if the initial if returns false. The <em>else if</em>&nbsp;is like another if statement that has been chained to the first one. There is no limit to the number of else if statements that can be included in a single block of code. However, only one if or else if statement code block will be run. The <strong><a href=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/there-can-be-only-one.jpg\">first</a></strong> such statement that returns true will have its code executed and the rest will be skipped:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (false) {&nbsp;<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">console.log('This will be skipped!'); } </span>\n<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">  else if (true) { console.log('This code will be run.'); } </span>\n<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">  else if (true) { console.log('This code will NOT be run.'); }\n</span></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>else statement</strong> will always come at the <em>end</em> of an if-else chain. It acts as a default, if no other condition is met; so if none of the expressions return true, the else code block will execute. The opposite is also true. If any of the previous if/else expressions are true, the else statement code block will not run.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">if (false) { console.log('This will be skipped!'); } \n  else if (false) { console.log('This code will NOT be run'); } \n  else { console.log('This code will be run'); }</pre>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why use else if?</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the difference between using a bunch of if statements versus using else if? When using an if/else block, only one code block will execute, even if more than one are true. The <em>first</em> one will run. If a series of if statements are run, <em>every one of them that is true</em> will run. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">const age = 21; //using if/else statements\n\nif (age &gt; 20){ console.log('older than 20!'); } \n  else if (age &gt; 15){ console.log('older than 15!'); } \n  else { console.log('younger than 15!'); }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example only <em>older than 20!</em> will be logged even though the first two statements were true.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">const age = 21; //using multiple if statements\n\nif (age &gt; 20){ console.log('older than 20!'); } \nif (age &gt; 15){ console.log('older than 15!'); } \nif (age &lt;= 15) { console.log('younger than 15!'); }</pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example the first two if statements would console log because both of them are true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, its up to the person writing the code to decide between having multiple actions based on input/data or just one action.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-rich wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hfpQzCTtz_A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in&nbsp;Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

After 2 long days of setbacks, I passed the Lambda School Challenge. This time around, I anticipated two things:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I was going to have to use outside help to pass, which is apparently the norm, so I had Google, Stack Overflow and some other sites ready and waiting.</li>\n<li>I knew that the hardest questions were going to be about methods in arrays which hadn&#8217;t been covered in the pre-course.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The first question was actually something that we had covered in class &#8211; but as I expected, it centered on an array. Without going into details, because we&#8217;re not supposed to share the questions, the solution had to do with using the .push method on the array. Luckily, when I made my cheat sheet the other night, I included a code example which helped me to come up with the correct solution quickly.</p>\n<p>The second question was also focused on an array. It asked us to modify the given function to return a certain class of number. In a word &#8211; it was a repeat question from yesterday! So, I was able to reference my answer and knock it out almost immediately. This left me with close to 40 mins for the final question.</p>\n<p>The last question was something new. We had to modify yet another function to return a new array with 3 sets of paired information. We had to filter it for a certain requirement and return one piece of data from the pairs which qualified. At first, I thought I could figure it out, and I started working to do that, but then I realized &#8211; we&#8217;re being asked to use outside resources to complete these tasks, so I did that.</p>\n<p>The answer to that exact problem was posted online. I felt somewhat bad doing it, but completing that question was nothing more than a cut-and-paste job. I did first copy everything into repl.it, to make sure that it would all work, and after about 20 seconds of work, it did, so:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"254\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/23/i-passed-the-lambda-school-challenge/8-mins/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1168,370\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"8 mins\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-254\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg\" alt=\"8 mins\" width=\"1168\" height=\"370\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg 1168w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=150&amp;h=48 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=300&amp;h=95 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=768&amp;h=243 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/8-mins.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=324 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px\" /></p>\n<p>My cohort starts classes on August 5th.

Its basically conditionals and branching so that a program doesn&#8217;t just do everything in its code, from the first line to the last &#8211; it lets the program do things based on input and conditions. The sections covered include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Control flow</li>\n<li>Undefined and Null</li>\n<li>Truthiness</li>\n<li>Comparison Operators</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Control Flow</h4>\n<p>As per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow\"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a>:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In computer science, control flow (or flow of control) is the order in which individual statements, instructions or function calls of an imperative program are executed or evaluated. The emphasis on explicit control flow distinguishes an imperative programming language from a declarative programming language.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Within an imperative programming language, a control flow statement is a statement, the execution of which results in a choice being made as to which of two or more paths to follow. For non-strict functional languages, functions and language constructs exist to achieve the same result, but they are usually not termed control flow statements.</em></p>\n<p>Essentially, control flow is the process by which programs become dynamic and can respond to a user&#8217;s input or some other stimulus, to cause it to act in a specific manner based on that input/stimulus. Everything from typing in a word processor (which causes letters to appear on a screen) to pressing spacebar to jump in a computer game &#8211; any action, essentially, is dependent on control flow. In real life, its akin to a person turning left or turning right on a road, or making any other choice, really.</p>\n<p>Flow is generally dependent on a <strong>condition.</strong> Its generally a true/false condition. If something is true, take this action. If its not, take this other action instead. Its possible to even await a variety of &#8220;trues&#8221;, but in that case, generally only the first one to trigger happens &#8211; for example, maybe in a computer game, a player can jump, move left, move right, make an attack (which can be one of a variety of attacks), use an item (probably also one of a variety of options), open a map or other window (like a character inventory or maybe a chat system)&#8230; whichever of these is activated first is what happens. Computers are fast enough that many of these actions can even be chained together so they appear as if they&#8217;re all happening at once, or at least happening in &#8220;real time&#8221;. For example, a person&#8217;s character could move left WHILE jumping and making an attack in midair &#8211; 3 actions, which happen within a split second of each other, but to our perception are effectively viewed as a single process.</p>\n<p>For purposes of this pre-course, and probably the full course to follow, flow will likely be simpler though. I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll mainly be based on clicking hyperlinks or using a drop-down or other selector to make decisions on a web page, or typing in information and having the program perform an action based on that.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of flow control and comparison operators from the pre-course. It will check to see if a condition is true, and execute code accordingly.</p>\n<pre>function canDrive(age) {\nif (age &gt; 15) {\nreturn true;\n}\nreturn false;\n}\ncanDrive(16); // true</pre>\n<p>What we have here is a function, and an <strong>if statement</strong>. The if statement looks at a condition to see if its true. In this care, its looking at a variable called <em>age</em> and testing to see if that variable is greater than the number 15. If it is, it returns a <em>true</em> response to the main program, which (if the function name is to be believed) indicates that the person whose age was reviewed is old enough to drive. If the number is not greater than 15 (its 15 or less), then it returns <em>false,</em> indicating that the person is not old yet old enough, but can maybe pay for gas.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The “Greater Than” symbol ( &gt; ) that you see in the last example is called a Comparison Operator. Comparison Operators evaluate two items and return either true or false. These operators are: &lt; , &lt;=, &gt;, &gt;=, ===, !== . We will learn more about these operators later in this lesson.</em></p>\n<h4>Undefined and Null</h4>\n<p>Undefined and null are values which can be assigned to variables in JavaScript. <strong>Undefined</strong> means that something does not exist &#8211; either a variable does not exist or it doesn&#8217;t have a value yet. Its assigned by the computer. <strong>Null</strong> is a value that&#8217;s assigned by a developer to a variable or object. It means that the item exists, but it does not yet have a value assigned to it.</p>\n<pre>console.log(unkownVar); // undefined</pre>\n<pre>let phoneNumber = ‘123-456-7890’;\n\nphoneNumber = null;\n\nphoneNumer; // null</pre>\n<p>I know that in our software at work, the development team often assign &#8220;null&#8221; to fields in our database that don&#8217;t have information yet, but still are important parts of a collection of data about a patient. For example, if a new patient is entered into the system, and data entry has only just begun, their phone number might initially be set to null, until its changed by a user in the Admissions department.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>One last thing to note, neither undefined nor null are strings. They are written just as they are with no quotes around them, like a Boolean.</em></p>\n<h4>Truthiness</h4>\n<p>Boolean values can be either true or false. Because of this, its easy to make decisions based on them, both in real life and in programming. If its raining outside, carry an umbrella basically means that if raining = true then execute the procedure to search helplessly for an umbrella in working condition in the house and try to sneak out with it before the kids see. Other variables in JavaScript have an inherent true/false value associated with them as well. They can essentially reduce down to a Boolean value.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In these lessons, we have talked a lot about the Boolean values, true and false. When using an if statement or other statements that expect a Boolean value (such as the !, NOT), and the expression given is not a Boolean value, JavaScript will do something called type coercion and transform whatever it is given into a Boolean value. This is known as truthy and falsey. Every data type has a truthiness to it. Here are some examples:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>items that are coerced to true:</em></p>\n<pre>true\n1\n’ ’\n[] // an array, you’ll learn more about this later\n{} // an object, you’ll learn more about this later\nfunction() {}</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>items that are coerced to false:</em></p>\n<pre>false\n0\nundefined\nnull\n''</pre>\n<h4>Comparison Operators</h4>\n<p>Comparison operators (&gt;, &gt;=, &lt;, &lt;=, ===, !==) evaluate two expressions to determine if their values are the same (equal) or different (not equal, greater than, less than, etc.). Essentially, as math is performed on an expression, it is evaluated down to being true or false (or, more accurately, coerced).</p>\n<pre>1 &gt; 2; // false\n2 &lt; 3; // true\n10 &gt;= 10; // true\n100 &lt;= 1; // false</pre>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The “triple equals” sign ( === ) must not be confused with a single equal sign (which indicates assigning a value to a variable). The triple equal will compare everything about the two items, including type, and return if they are exactly equal or not: (Something to note: there is a “double equals” ( == ) sign which will compare two items, but it will NOT take into account their types (1 == &#8216;1&#8217; // true). Due to this, it is considered bad practice to use the double equal sign. We would like to see you always using the triple equal sign, and you will always see us using it.)</em></p>\n<pre>1 === 1; // true\n1 === '1'; // false\n'cat' === 'cat'; // true\n'cat' === 'Cat'; // false</pre>\n<p>Finally, we have the <strong>NOT (!</strong>) and <strong>NOT EQUAL (!==)</strong> comparison operators. &#8220;Not&#8221; (!) means use the opposite value of an expression &#8211; so, if its true, then use false, and vice versa. &#8220;Not equal&#8221; (!==) means that the two values are not equal in any manner. It will return true if the items being compared are NOT equal to each other, <em>either by value or type</em>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>!=</strong> checks the value of two expressions (and older, looser comparison operator)</li>\n<li><strong>!==</strong> checks both the value and type (the newer, stricter comparison operator)</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>1 !== 1; // false\n1 !== '1'; // true\n'cat' !== 'cat'; // false\n'cat' !== 'Cat'; // true</pre>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Ro2uIYx9mI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

failed the Lambda School Challenge again, this AM","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/23/i-failed-the-lambda-school-challenge-again-this-am/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-3j","content":"<p>So, after getting stymied by the third problem on the Lambda School Challenge yesterday, I stayed up all night and worked through nearly the entire JavaScript part of the pre-course again. I didn&#8217;t run through the last two sections, because by that time, it was 7:30 AM and I had to stay with the baby while my wife got ready for work. I work from home the majority of the time, so I&#8217;m also essentially a stay-at-home dad a lot too.</p>\n<p>While working through the whole thing, I created a cheat sheet as I went, with small programming examples of everything that was being covered, so that I&#8217;d have them handy to reference formats as needed. Its 2 pages long right now, and I think that when I add the last two topics, it&#8217;ll be a full 3 pages.</p>\n<p>I saw that time was approaching, so I tried retaking the challenge at around 6:00 AM, but found that I couldn&#8217;t. You can only attempt the challenge once per day, but it doesn&#8217;t reset at midnight &#8211; its once every 24 hours, so I had to wait until around 8:45 to try again.</p>\n<p>The time came. The baby woke up and I had her grandparents watch her while I locked myself in the office and drew up my cheat sheets, ready for battle. It was worse this time. All three questions were things that hadn&#8217;t been covered in class. I had to go to Google for help with all of them.</p>\n<p>The first challenge asked for me to modify a function to return the number of a certain set of letters in a string. We didn&#8217;t cover anything like this in the pre-course. I had to find a way to identify only the letters asked for in the string, count them, and then return that value. I ended up Googling the question and found an answer online, which I modified and made work with the function I was given.</p>\n<p>It felt like I was cheating, because the process and code weren&#8217;t really my own. I can understand why people experience impostor syndrome when coding. I also felt like I had been cheated, because other than being able to follow the format necessary to modify a function, this wasn&#8217;t something that had been covered in the pre-course, so it wasn&#8217;t something I&#8217;d spent the last 2 weeks actually sitting down and learning. It really feels like everything I studied was for nothing, since I&#8217;m not being asked to use any of that knowledge.</p>\n<p>The next challenge asked me to modify a function to return a number in a particular size category in a given array. Again, this wasn&#8217;t something that had been covered in class. I was forced to rely on Google again, and not the material from the pre-course. This ended up being a one-line solution, which amazed me. It also used a type of command with all punctuation and no letters, which I&#8217;ve never seen before. And yes, it was disheartening to know that 2/3 of the test so far were on things that weren&#8217;t in the pre-course. They might as well have asked me to duplicate the reflection of a painting in the pupil of the eye of a subject in a Flemish painting. It was equally covered in the pre-course.</p>\n<p>Ok. So, with two of the questions answered &#8211; more by w3schools and Stack Overflow than me &#8211; I moved on to the third. Lo and behold: a question about a topic which hadn&#8217;t been covered in the pre-course. That. Never. Happens. At least, not to me&#8230;</p>\n<p>Ok. I had a little more than 15 minutes left to solve this riddle. Load an array and put something they gave me into a certain part of it &#8211; not a part explicitly identified by the index in the array either, and it had to work with 3 different arrays that, of course, had different items in it.</p>\n<p>Google. w3schools. Mozilla Developer Network. Stack Overflow. By their powers combined, I was able to come up with a solution &#8211; that didn&#8217;t work. Onscreen, it looked like it should work. The syntax was right. When I tested each individual element, they returned the right data on the screen. The output was all undefined. I focused. I made changes, even though they didn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;d make a difference. They didn&#8217;t. I reviewed the articles on the websites and comments. Everyone was using the same format as me. They were getting the right results. I was getting undefined. The clock ticked down. I was reading documentation about the new command that I was certain could do the job. I checked the tab with the challenge: 4..3..2..1. Out of Time.</p>\n<p>I kind of want to write pseudo-code to replace <em>time</em> with <em>my mind</em> and revise the close of that last paragraph. But yeah. I failed again. Its really annoying that we&#8217;re being tested on something that we&#8217;re not being taught. I can understand it a little, because at work we&#8217;re faced with unique problems that need research to solve every week. Its not novel to this challenge. What is, is having to do it three times in a row in a 45 minute period.</p>\n<p>But yeah, this, too, shall pass.</p>\n<p>So, after bombing the last question again, I went to the Slack and asked if anyone could look at my code and help me understand why it didn&#8217;t work. I didn&#8217;t post anything about the actual problem, and asked that it be done via private message, so it doesn&#8217;t influence anyone else who&#8217;s taking the challenge. For the most part, I got people telling me that they can&#8217;t help with the challenge, until they understood that I wasn&#8217;t asking for help with a live challenge &#8211; I was asking for a code review for something that wasn&#8217;t working so that I could understand it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"219\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/23/i-failed-the-lambda-school-challenge-again-this-am/slack-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"908,148\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"slack-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg?w=908\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-219\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg\" alt=\"slack-4\" width=\"908\" height=\"148\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg 908w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=24 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=49 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=125 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 908px) 100vw, 908px\" /></p>\n<p>One person did private message me, and he ended up being really helpful. He didn&#8217;t point out explicitly what the issue was, but after the two of us analyzed it, and he did some outside research, he helped me think through it and we found the issue. My implementation of the new command was fine &#8211; but that command had a behavior that wasn&#8217;t documented in any of the resources that I&#8217;d gone through in my rush to solve the problem. If I&#8217;d had more time, I&#8217;d probably have caught it, but ultimately, the command would update the array, which was fine, but then it basically held the value of whatever was removed from the array &#8211; which in this case, was nothing. So, it was supplying me with nothing (hence, undefined) in my answer when I returned its data outside of the function.</p>\n<p>It took about an hour, but after we discovered that behavior, I figured out that I should return the array itself, not the update from the new command. I had copied the challenge problem into repl.it, so I could work on it after the challenge, and I finally got it to return the right answers after learning about that behavior &#8211; which none of the commentors on Stack or anywhere else mentioned.</p>\n<p>So, I learned something about programming, and I learned something about frustration and perseverance and human aid.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"220\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/23/i-failed-the-lambda-school-challenge-again-this-am/challenge-wait-to-retake-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1168,895\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"challenge wait to retake 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-220\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg\" alt=\"challenge wait to retake 2\" width=\"1168\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg 1168w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=115 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=230 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=588 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-wait-to-retake-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=785 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1168px) 100vw, 1168px\" /></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll try again tomorrow.

You have to answer 3 questions in 45 minutes to pass. All three of my questions were JavaScript code which I had to modify to get specific answers. I got through the first two questions in under 5 minutes and felt pretty good about my ability to pass.</p>\n<p>There was a warm-up question before the real ones began. Mine had me modify a function to return True, which I was able to do quickly. I then moved onto the actual challenge.</p>\n<p>The first question asked me to modify a function so that more than one variable&#8217;s boolean value returned certain results. It was fairly easy and I was able to answer it by writing a simple method.</p>\n<p>The second one asked me to add a method to an array prototype that returned True under certain conditions and False if those conditions weren&#8217;t met. I was able to do this without any trouble as well.</p>\n<p>Then it was time for the 3rd question. I had about 40 mins to complete it, but didn&#8217;t know that this was what the real challenge was. I had to modify a function to return a copy of a given array, which shouldn&#8217;t have been an issue &#8211; but it had to be sorted in ascending order, and the original array couldn&#8217;t be modified. The array was numeric. The answer/output would also look at two items to determine if it was successful: the order of the numbers in the original array, and the order of the numbers in the new one.</p>\n<p>Sorting isn&#8217;t something that we covered in the pre-course. I thought this might have to do with push/pop methods in an array, and started sketching out an algorithm in Notepad, to give me some guidance when writing the code, but I wasn&#8217;t successful. I watched the timer click down, and by the time I had 5 minutes left, I knew that I wasn&#8217;t going to succeed.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I was greeted with this:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"196\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/22/i-failed-the-lambda-school-challenge-this-am/challenge-failed/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1341,895\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"challenge failed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-196\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg\" alt=\"challenge failed\" width=\"1341\" height=\"895\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg 1341w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=768&amp;h=513 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/challenge-failed.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1341px) 100vw, 1341px\" /></p>\n<p>I checked out the Slack channel. After completing the pre-course, I had posted there to share my initial success with my potential future cohort. This time, I wrote a message announcing my challenge failure, and asking about the 3rd question. What I really wanted to know was &#8211; since it asked about topics that hadn&#8217;t been covered in the pre-course, were we supposed to go outside, like to Google or Stack Overflow, or somewhere else for help?</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"197\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/22/i-failed-the-lambda-school-challenge-this-am/slack-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"922,226\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"slack-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg?w=922\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-197\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg\" alt=\"slack-1\" width=\"922\" height=\"226\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg 922w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=37 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=74 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=188 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 922px) 100vw, 922px\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently, the answer was <strong><a href=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/slack-3.jpg\">yes</a></strong>.

The main point was that a Lambda graduate could conceivably go to school for 7 months, job hunt for 3 months and land a job, then work for an additional 3 years, getting experience and building a portfolio &#8211; and the cost isn&#8217;t astronomical. A college graduate, at that same point in time (4 years of schooling) might attempt to enter the workforce with essentially no experience, unless internships were had, and a degree. That student might even end up being interviewed BY the Lambda graduate, depending on the company being applied to!

I&#8217;ve worked with developers for years who are wizards at math, but I&#8217;m not particularly adept, although I&#8217;m not incompetent either. This course might begin to show me how necessary math is to programming, and if it is &#8211; what types of math and to what areas of programming.</p>\n<p>At work, we do use math in our software for performing clinical calculations. For example, there are several standards for determining percentage of weight change (gain or loss) and related to that are calculations for caloric intake and calories burned that are part of our nutritional assessment, for dieticians. This has modifiers for if the patient has certain conditions, like recovering from various injuries (say, skeletal trauma has a particular weight that modifies the total score), activity factor and other things. Data like this then computes things like maintenance calories (how many calories a patient needs each day to stay at their current weight), estimated protein needs, estimated fluid needs, and so on.</p>\n<p>Nurses have their own math-related concerns that they track with our software, often related to pressure ulcers or other wounds, patterns of oral consumption &#8211; which can affect weight (a big concern for both nursing and dietary), and formulas related to ADL&#8217;s (Activities of Daily Living) which can impact how much money a nursing home is paid for support, per resident. The finance side has a TON of math which ties in to every clinical department&#8217;s work &#8211; social work&#8217;s psychological assessments, therapeutic activities&#8217; work with the resident, and so on. There are a lot of modifiers to consider when viewing a patient&#8217;s entire situation and the impact it has on revenue for a facility as well as tracking changes when moving to and from hospitals and other nursing homes.</p>\n<p>With that out of the way, JavaScript, like all other programming languages that I&#8217;m aware of, has the ability to solve math problems. Solving math is actually one of the core functions of a computer. I know that numbers control everything on a screen, to some extent. The pixels we look at are on a 2-dimensional grid. 3D graphics require a bit of processing and there are definitely equations running in the background determining how these moving 3-dimensional objects maintain form and motion &#8211; which then adds a physics engine on top of that, which is powered by more math, and so on.</p>\n<p>As someone who hasn&#8217;t programmed on that level, I&#8217;ve never had to deal with any of this at work. Aside from using numbers to add padding, space, control font sizes, and that sort of thing to various sections of our application&#8217;s interface, I can&#8217;t say I&#8217;ve thought about anything even as basic as a Pythagorean Theorem since high school. I&#8217;ve researched formulas for assessment sections that need them, but all of this is math that was done by someone else that I helped determine needed to be incorporated into our program. The development team took it to the next level and actually&#8230; did the math and made it work successfully. Maybe this course will change my perception about how heavily math is needed for programming. Right now, I think that acting on the value of a piece of data, and on user input, is more important.</p>\n<h4>Math Operators</h4>\n<p>JavaScript has operators that perform the 4 basic math functions that we all had to learn as children: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. There&#8217;s a 5th basic function as well now, called <strong>modulo.</strong> Its just the remainder, left over from doing division &#8211; so the modulo of 5/2 is 1, because 2 into 5 is 2, with 1 left over. The keyboard characters that we use for basic math are as follows:</p>\n<pre>+ for addition: 1 + 1 = 2\n- for subtraction: 3 - 2 = 1\n* for multiplication: 3 * 2 = 6\n/ for division, and: 10 / 2 = 5\n% for modulo: 9 % 3 = 0</pre>\n<h4>Properties and Methods</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Primitive data types (and other data types) have built-in functionality known as properties and methods. These extend the functionality of the primitive data types and allow us to gather information about them, or manipulate them in some way. Both properties and methods will be accessed using the dot notation where we give the name of the variable, a dot, then the name of the property or method.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>variableName.propertyName;</em></p>\n<h4>Properties</h4>\n<p><strong>Properties</strong> are essentially metadata about a variable &#8211; things like the length (number of characters) in a string, for example. According to <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_string.asp\"><strong>w3schools</strong></a>, its possible to add custom properties to a variable. For example, a variable called electricBass could have properties like brand, stringNum, handedness, and so on.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the dot notation described in the Lambda School text, those properties would be accessed by the following names:</p>\n<pre>electricBass.brand\nelectricBass.stringNum\nelectricBass.handedness</pre>\n<p>Going along with the bass analogy, some possible values for brand could be &#8220;Fender&#8221;, &#8220;Gibson&#8221;, &#8220;Schecter&#8221; or &#8220;Ibanez&#8221;. Values for stringNum could include 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 (yes, I know Jaco only needed 4 strings). Values for handedness could be &#8220;left&#8221; or &#8220;right&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The example below gives us the length of a string, or how many characters it contains (spaces count).</p>\n<pre>const favoriteSteak = 'ribeye';\nfavoriteSteak.length; //6</pre>\n<h4>Methods</h4>\n<p>A <strong>method</strong> is essentially a function or action that can be embedded or placed inside of a variable (or other object, apparently). Methods allow customized actions to be performed on specific variables or data types. They&#8217;re called like properties, but with an additional set of parenthesis at the end. For example:</p>\n<pre>var dialogue = \"Hello! My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father... \n  prepare to die!\";\nvar x = message.toUpperCase();</pre>\n<p>The above would return:</p>\n<pre>HELLO! MY NAME IS INIGO MONTOYA. YOU KILLED MY FATHER... \nPREPARE TO DIE!</pre>\n<h3>Global objects and methods</h3>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>JavaScript has a number of built-in objects for us to use. These global objects extend the functionality of the language for us for free. We have already seen, and have been using, the console object and its method log. Another one of these objects is Math. Math has a number of methods on it just like console has log. To add to this, some of our data types also have built-in methods.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_math.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Math Object</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_math.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Math Reference</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math\">Mozilla Developer&#8217;s Network: Math</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Math.pow</h4>\n<p>The <strong>pow</strong> method in Math raises a number to its exponent. It uses two numbers to do this &#8211; the base number and the power to raise it to (square, cube, etc.). It looks like this:</p>\n<pre>Math.pow(2,2) = 4;\nMath.pow(3,2) = 9;\nMath.pow(3,3) = 27;</pre>\n<h4>Rounding decimals in JavaScript</h4>\n<p>The Math object has many methods in it. Some of these are used for rounding numbers. They are <strong>Math.round</strong>, <strong>Math.floor</strong> and <strong>Math.ceil</strong> and will round decimal numbers to the nearest whole number.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Math.round</strong> works in the manner that most people are familiar with &#8211; if a decimal is .50 or higher, it rounds up to the next whole number. If its .49 or lower, it rounds down.</li>\n<li><strong>Math.floor</strong> always rounds down to the nearest whole number, so 99.99 would round to 99, not 100.</li>\n<li><strong>Math.ceil</strong> (or ceiling) does the opposite of .floor. It rounds up to the nearest whole number, regardless of the value of the decimal (as long as its not .00). So, 9.01 would round up to 10.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>Math.round(6.5) = 7;\nMath.round(6.45) = 6;\nMath.floor(6.999) = 6;\nMath.ceil(6.0001) = 7;</pre>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4Yhoj4Ovyo?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

HTML and CSS handle displaying content. JavaScript allows web pages and web applications to accept user input and act on it. That&#8217;s really the big difference between markup and programming. There are some people who split hairs and differentiate between scripting and programming. The main difference seems to be that scripting languages aren&#8217;t generally compiled into machine language or turned into executable files. They&#8217;re run and interpreted on-the-fly. Programming languages have to be compiled and turned into 0&#8217;s and 1&#8217;s before they can be run &#8211; and are generally turned into executable files.</p>\n<h3>What is JavaScript and why do we use it?</h3>\n<p>As stated earlier, JavaScript is a programming language that was developed to add interactivity and functionality to websites. It was developed in 1994 and was intended to be a front end technology for web developers. Originally, it only ran in web browsers, but in 2008, Google developed the &#8220;<strong><a href=\"https://v8.dev/\">V8 engine</a></strong>&#8221; which improved its functionality and speed. This, in turn, led to the creation of new front end frameworks and to the release of <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\"><strong>Node.js</strong></a>, a technology which allows JavaScript to run on the back end, or on servers. Essentially, it can now be used to write applications that are not confined to the browser.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We can find JavaScript used on the front end, back end, mobile, Internet of Things (Iot), game development, and really anywhere a traditional programming language would be used. Recently, the newest version of the JavaScript language was released, ES6*. We will be focusing on and using ES6 in this course, and in the full Lambda School CS course.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>*even newer versions have come out (ES7, ES8, etc) but this release is where a major paradigm shift happened. We will be referring to any concepts released after ES6, to simply ES6.</em></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://es6-features.org/#Constants\">ES6</a></strong>, or ECMAScript/ECMAScript 2015 is a standard, and JavaScript is an implementation of that standard. Apparently, the name ES6 can be used interchangeably with JavaScript, and the version of JavaScript which supports it is also called JavaScript 6.</p>\n<h4>JavaScript vs Java (and other languages)</h4>\n<p>JavaScript and Java are not the same language. They&#8217;re actually not even directly related to each other. The name was essentially a marketing ploy, meant to ride on the coattails of Java&#8217;s popularity. The language uses concepts from other programming languages, including <strong>Java</strong> and <strong>C</strong>, but also lesser-known ones like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)\"><strong>Self</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)\"><strong>Scheme</strong></a>.</p>\n<p>Its also considered a ‘loosely’ typed language. This means that <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type\">data types</a></strong> exist, but they are not strictly enforced. Types are essentially different kinds of data &#8211; some types are alphanumeric (containing letters, numbers and symbols), some only contain numbers (or certain kinds of numbers &#8211; generally either with or without decimals), and others hold information like &#8220;True/False&#8221;. (I don&#8217;t quite understand the significance of loosely-typed languages vs. those which strictly enforce type, but I&#8217;m sure it will be revealed with time.)</p>\n<h4>How to ‘run’ JavaScript</h4>\n<p>JavaScript can apparently be typed in a browser via a <strong>console</strong> that&#8217;s built into many browsers (F12 in Chrome). This isn&#8217;t the most common way of running it, however. Most JavaScript is saved to files with the .js extension, loaded by a browser and run from there. The browser generally loads JavaScript code when an HTML tag on a web page calls for a .js file to be loaded and run.</p>\n<p>Node.js additionally allows JavaScript to be executed from a server via the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface\"><strong>command line</strong></a>, now. So, applications can be written using JavaScript and run outside of a web browser using Node.js as its launching point.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>For this class, we are going to use a special code sandbox program just like we did with the last lesson (CodePen), called repl.it. This will allow us to write and edit our code and run it right in our browser window to see a real-time read-out.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://repl.it/\">Repl.it</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m unsure why we&#8217;re using repl.it to learn JavaScript, instead of continuing in <strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a>,</strong> which also supports JavaScript. I joined the <strong><a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a></strong> channel for the class last night, so I might inquire there and see if I get an answer.</p>\n<h4>Variables</h4>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)\">Variables</a></strong> are essentially containers that hold information. Usually, they hold only a specific kind of information, so when they&#8217;re created, they have to have a name and a type assigned to them. This identifies the variable and then defines what kind of data it can hold. If a program asks a user for his/her name, that information is stored in a variable for later use. If a user chooses a payment method when shopping online, that payment method is stored in a variable for later use. Essentially, anything that gathers information or allows choice or branching is usually a variable, and the information in a variable can change. Names can be misspelled and then corrected (and passwords, as most people come to learn), the total cost of an item from an online store can change, based on discounts, shipping cost and tax. All of these pieces of information are saved in variables.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>At the heart of JavaScript are variables. A variable is a way to store the value of something to use later. (A note for those with previous programming knowledge: JavaScript is a loosely-typed language, which means that a variable can be set (and reset) to any type. We do not need to declare its type when initiating the variable.)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The anatomy of a variable is first the keyword, a space, the name we are giving the variable, an equal sign, the value we are assigning the variable, and then a semicolon.</em></p>\n<p>There are three ways to <strong>declare</strong> a variable. Declaring a variable creates it in a program by giving it a name, usually a data type, and very often a starting value. Until a variable is declared, it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<pre>var firstName = 'John';</pre>\n<pre>let lastName = 'Wick';</pre>\n<pre>const favoriteFood = 'steak';</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Var</strong> is a statement used to declare a variable. It existed before ES6 was created, and is thought of as the ES5 (or old) way of declaring variables. Variables declared this was are <strong>global,</strong> which means they exist throughout the entire program.</li>\n<li><strong>Let</strong> is a new ES6 variable keyword. Its variables are <strong>block-limited.</strong> Let will assign a variable like var, but that variable only exists in the block of code in which it was created &#8211; often this is a loop, or some other chunk of code. Variables declared using let don&#8217;t exist outside of the block of code that they were declared in, so they can&#8217;t be used outside of it.</li>\n<li><strong>Const</strong> is also new in ES6. A const is a variable that cannot be changed. It’s short for “constant”. Its used in a lot of other programming languages. In our software, something like our clients&#8217; company name and address would be a constant.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Primitive Data Types (String, Number, Boolean)</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The term ‘primitive data type’ refers to the fact that these are the most basic data types in the language. All other data types (which we will learn about in later lessons) use these types.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Strings</strong> are blocks of text. They are defined with quotation marks around them, either single or double. Any text with quotes around it is a string. <em>(const dog = &#8216;fido&#8217;;)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Numbers</strong> are numeric data. They do NOT have quotes around them and can be negative. (<em>const answer = 42;) (const negative = -13;)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Booleans</strong> are <em>binary</em> variables and can have only 1 of 2 values: on or off, 0 or 1, true or false. In JavaScript, Booleans mean true or false and are used for logical branches or conditions. <em>(const baconisafoodgroup = true;)</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7n2-o07jNs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

Quiz","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/17/lambda-school-full-stack-web-development-pre-course-quiz/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-1T","content":"<p>So, yesterday, I completed the HTML and CSS sections of the pre-course material for <strong>Lambda School&#8217;s Full Stack Web Development</strong> track. At the end, there was a quiz that was broken into three parts. All of them used an online sandbox coding environment called <strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io\">CodePen</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>CodePen is my first virtual coding environment. I like how it functions, so far. There are three resizeable sections in the top half of the screen. These sections contain HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding areas, respectively. The bottom shows the output of the three coding screens, updating in real-time.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTo2ihSon4U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Without going into specifics, because I don&#8217;t want to spoil the quizzes for anyone who might read this and needs to take them:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The first part of the quiz is called &#8220;<strong>A quiz in which you determine what the specific style rule is for the specified selector.</strong>&#8221; It gives us HTML and CSS code to review at the top, and text at the bottom. We&#8217;re asked to answer questions about CSS and how it was used to format certain elements of the web page. Some of these can get a little tricky, so make sure you understand the scope of what an element can contain and remember the <em>order</em> of how CSS takes effect.</li>\n<li>The second part of the quiz is called &#8220;<strong>An exercise in which you give the specified HTML elements, their specified styling rules.</strong>&#8221; I found that this was a bit easier to go through than the first part of the quiz because it asks us to write our own CSS code to make certain page elements look a certain way, instead of having us inspect existing code. Both are good exercises though. This was fun because it was also actual coding, so I was finally able to put into practice some of the things I&#8217;d been reading about previously.</li>\n<li>The third, and final, part of the quiz is called &#8220;<strong>An exercise in which you will build a basic web page for a business.</strong>&#8221; It asks us to write a web page from scratch using HTML and CSS. There were parameters that we had to meet, like using a certain number of specific HTML elements and CSS selectors and styling a number of HTML elements with specified CSS functions. I found this one fun, too, although I didn&#8217;t get to include the two stretch goals because one of them had no real impact on the visual aspects of the page I&#8217;d created, and the other simply didn&#8217;t seem to work when I tested it. The two stretch goals were also about CSS properties that had not been discussed in the pre-course. We were asked to research them online and use what we learn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Its silly, but here&#8217;s a link to my submission for the third part of the quiz. Its not pretty, but neither am I. It does include all of the elements that we were asked to include, and quite a few more, but could be beautified if the requirements didn&#8217;t ask for a bunch of specific elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/full/NZQByx\">CodePen: An exercise in which you will build a basic web page for a business.</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Next, I move on to <strong>JavaScript&#8230;</strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, yesterday, I completed the HTML and CSS sections of the pre-course material for Lambda School&#8217;s Full Stack Web Development track.

It goes over the following topics:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What is CSS?</li>\n<li>The STYLE and LINK elements</li>\n<li>Introduction to CSS Selectors</li>\n<li>Anatomy of Styling Rules (Syntax)</li>\n<li>Styling Rules</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>What is CSS?</h4>\n<p>CSS is an acronym for <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. Its a different language than HTML. HTML deals with placing elements onscreen &#8211; both inserting the data as well as positioning it. CSS is more focused on presenting that information in an eye-pleasing manner to the viewer. Its used to add color and other visual enhancements to HTML elements.</p>\n<p>One of the powers of CSS, which I wish I had taken more advantage of at work, is the ability to modify the properties of multiple HTML elements at once &#8211; not only on a single web page, but across multiple pages. As I said in a previous post, I didn&#8217;t know how to code in HTML or CSS, so I relied on <strong>Microsoft Expression Web</strong> and <strong>Visual Studio</strong> to design the interface for our EMR application at work. Those programs got the job done, but I was (and still am) adding inefficiency to our application. This is part of the reason that I joined Lambda School &#8211; I want to correct this.</p>\n<p>Currently, I use Expression Web to place CSS in each and every web page that I have designed for our application. This, of course, leads to larger file-size downloads for clients, slowing our system down, even if its only by seconds. Those do add up, and can even make an otherwise lean system feel sluggish. I was somewhat aware that CSS can be saved to its own file and called or referenced by other pages, so it doesn&#8217;t have to be duplicated (or recreated from scratch, in some of my work) for each page that needs it.</p>\n<p>But, as I was saying, one of the strengths of CSS is that it can be saved on a single file and called by other pages of a website or web application. This means that a developer can modify the appearance of an entire website from a central location &#8211; something I was unable to take advantage of because of my lack of knowledge. There was a period in which we spent about 9 months revising our entire system, with visual updates as well as reformatting certain sections &#8211; which coincided with actual program and logic updates due to changes in federal laws that we have to comply with. I had to update many elements of dozens of pages individually. This work could have been significantly reduced if I knew how to use CSS properly. My aim is to learn all of that now and employ it going forward.</p>\n<h4>The &#8220;STYLE&#8221; and &#8220;LINK&#8221; elements</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Before we can add CSS to our web page, we need to inform the browser that what it is reading is in fact CSS. We can tell the browser that through HTML elements known as the style and link elements. These elements will go in between the head tags, as it is not necessarily data we need to appear on the screen.</em></p>\n<p>There are two ways to let the browser know that CSS is included in our HTML:</p>\n<p>1. We can write CSS directly between two <strong>style</strong> tags. This is what I currently do, via Expression Web. Its fine for a single page, or a very small website or web application, but it falls short for larger projects.</p>\n<pre>&lt;style&gt;\n  &lt;CSS stuff goes in here&gt;\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<p>2. We can link to an external CSS file using the <strong>link</strong> element. This is the technique i&#8217;d like to learn and then utilize at work &#8211; which will cause me to have to modify all of the pages I already updated, but should make for a leaner and faster program.</p>\n<p>The link element includes two attributes: <strong>rel</strong> and <strong>href.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>rel</strong> refers to the type of file being linked to. For CSS, this file type is <strong>&#8220;stylesheet&#8221;.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>href</strong> points to the location of the file. Its generally a web address, because it points to a file on a webserver.</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>&lt;head&gt;\n  &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"www.website.com/folder/styles.css\" /&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Introduction to CSS Selectors</h4>\n<p>CSS selectors are commands that pick which HTML elements we want to style using CSS. Essentially, they&#8217;re commands that tell the browser, &#8220;Hey, make all of these boxes red&#8221; or &#8220;Turn all of these headers blue and make them bold&#8221; or &#8220;Change the text color for this specific paragraph to white and give it a border of this style and in this thickness.&#8221; So, they&#8217;re exactly what their name implies: they select what elements we want to apply a set of CSS code to.</p>\n<p>CSS can be used to select all elements of a certain type on a web page &#8211; so all paragraphs, divs, everything in the entire body, and so on. Elements can also be given custom names and CSS can select only the elements with that name. These are called <strong>classes</strong>. For example, at work, I might be updating a nursing assessment and I might want to group everything to do with vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure, height, weight, etc.) and give them a class called <em>vitals.</em> Then, I can style them all together and make them look the same. I might want to do the same with all medications that a patient is taking, and I can call that class <em>meds.</em></p>\n<p>An element can also be given an individual name. This is called an <strong>id.</strong> CSS could then be applied to only that particular element. For example, I might have a section on a form called contact info that has a patient&#8217;s name, address, phone number and other information needed to identify and contact him or her. I can give that specific section an id and call it <strong>contact_info,</strong> and then use CSS to style only that section. This way, even if its a paragraph, and other paragraphs are styled in a certain way, it can still be made distinct by essentially calling it out and giving it its own custom appearance.</p>\n<p>Selectors are applied to HTML tags as <em>attributes,</em> which means that they&#8217;re included inside of the element&#8217;s brackets. (Again, I spelled &#8220;div&#8221; as &#8220;d1v&#8221; to stop my browser from actually running the code.)</p>\n<pre>&lt;d1v id=\"contact_info\"&gt;&lt;/d1v&gt;\n&lt;d1v class=\"vitals\"&gt;&lt;/d1v&gt;</pre>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Id`s: are titles that can only appear on a single element. Think of it as you would your driver’s license number. ONLY you have that one number.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Classes: on the other hand can apply to multiple elements. Think of it like a classroom. Usually, you aren’t the only person in a class, although you might be. The class is big enough for lots of people.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp\">w3schools: CSS Selector Reference</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors\">Mozilla Developer Network: CSS Selectors</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Anatomy of Styling Rules (Syntax)</h4>\n<p>CSS, naturally, has its own syntax. It tells the browser which selectors to use and what style properties to apply to the selected elements.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Classes always begin with a period (.)</li>\n<li>IDs always begin with a hashtag (#)</li>\n<li>Elements just use their name (&lt;p&gt;)</li>\n<li>After a selector is named, the styling rules follow, encapsulated between curly braces ({})</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>&lt;style&gt;\n  body {CSS stuff that affects all elements on a page goes here}\n  .vitals {CSS stuff for the vital signs class goes here}\n  #contact_info {CSS stuff for the resident's contact info section}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<p>Styling rules follow this format: Inside of the braces we have the property name, a colon and the property&#8217;s value. The style for that property is closed by a semicolon.</p>\n<pre>div {\nstyling_property: value of rule;\n}</pre>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<pre>&lt;style&gt;\np {\n  font-size: 20px;\n  color: blue;\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Styling Rules</h4>\n<p>Once HTML elements are selected, they can be styled with CSS. There are many ways to style an object: size, color, placement on screen, visibility, and more. Three of the more common ones are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>background</strong> or <strong>background-color</strong><br />\nThe most common uses for background are setting an image or paragraph&#8217;s background color. To be more explicit, &#8220;background-color&#8221; can be used to set the color of the background &#8211; there are actually a bunch of different background properties that can be manipulated.</p>\n<pre>.vitals {\n  background: red;\n}\n\n#contact_info {\n  background: url('http://www.website.com/folder/backg.jpg');\n}\n\nbody {\n  background-color: blue;\n}</pre>\n<p><strong>color</strong><br />\nColor sets the color of the selected text.</p>\n<pre>p {\n  color: magenta;\n}</pre>\n<p><strong>font-size<br />\n</strong>This property sets the size of text. Px, or pixel, is the most commonly used, but other units (like inches) or percentages (120%) or even certain text descriptors (large) can also be used.</p>\n<pre>.vitals {\nfont-size: 15px;\n}\n\n#contact_info {\nfont-size: large;\n}\n\ndiv {\nfont-size: 150%;\n}</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/default.asp\">w3schools: CSS Properties Reference</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0CidPIcnCck?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

frightening) video from <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-91UA-Xy2Cvb98deRXuggA\">Joshua Fluke</a></strong>. This one goes into his history and why he&#8217;s anti-corporate and pro-entrepreneur. I had something like what he experienced happen to me &#8211; twice. My first job in I/T came when I was 21 or 22 years old. A friend and I were the entire department. We did all of the I/T work for 3 campuses of a large nursing home company in NY. I was paid $9/hour when entry level at the time (around 1999) was twice that.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbUvTbD9q4A?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>My friend and I were finally getting overwhelmed. We shone working at the main campus, but when two others were tacked on, responsibilities multiplied accordingly. We scheduled a meeting with our manager. She brought it some other people and we made out case that we needed more resources (we listed hardware and software, with explanations about what each was for) and we knew that we were worth more than we were getting paid, so we also asked for more compensation &#8211; out workload was high, we traveled on our own dime to other campuses and I, personally, stayed late every day to help the evening shift nurses and other personnel without getting paid for it.</p>\n<p>All of our requests were denied.</p>\n<p>I remember meeting individually with our manager afterward. I was depressed and thought that she was on our side, because she had helped set up the meeting with herself and others higher than her. It turned out that she was the one who had denied each and every request. She told me something that burned my ear and remains with me to this day, when I told her that I felt that I was being used and taken advantage of, and that no one above us had been listening. She said, &#8220;If I didn&#8217;t do it to you, someone else would have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We left and got recruited to Pepsi Corporation shortly thereafter. My salary jumped to $27/hour &#8211; through an I/T company that&#8217;s no longer around. No overtime or benefits, of course, but the money was fantastic, coming from someone who had been making $9/hour before that. It turned out, they had been charging PepsiCo $120/hour for my services. The recruiter took a chunk of that, and the company took the rest.</p>\n<p>After a few years (with different recruiting companies) at PepsiCo and then Pepsi Bottling Group, IBM took over several departments and ousted the old guard. I trained the 3 people who replaced me. They tried to recruit me, but were making a little more than half of what I was, so I declined. I ended up at an I/T headhunting company, because the recruiter from my last stint at Pepsi (who was a decent and moral person that I wish I stayed in contact with) saw my value and was trying to help me stay employed. I never made a placement at that company. I came close once, and right as I was finalizing a deal, one of the other people who had been at the company longer than me suddenly stepped up and said that the people I was speaking to were part of his working group, and took the deal from me.
