I started on Tuesday, August 10th and today is Tuesday September 7th. In a few days, I&#8217;ll have made it through my first calendar month. Its not at all what I expected. My understanding is that I would be working on the company&#8217;s business application, and I am, but not via code. At least not yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My initial task is to help connect the company&#8217;s software with <strong><a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a></strong>, which is an online integration tool. It basically lets developers connect an application&#8217;s <strong>API </strong>to it so that connected applications can communicate with each other. Its a middleman. There are &#8220;triggers&#8221; that can be specified in one program which will cause &#8220;effects&#8221; to happen in another. So, if you create a customer in your application (the trigger), that data is sent to Zapier&#8217;s API and then beamed into a linked application to cause something to happen there (the effect). For example, a new customer can be created in a CRM which will cause a new customer and an invoice to be generated in Quickbooks Online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the backend and API for the company&#8217;s program is written in <strong>C#</strong>. I had started building out a backend <strong>Node</strong> &amp; <strong>Express</strong> application to speak with the company&#8217;s API and was going to connect it to Zapier, but the person who heads development instead suggested that we upgrade the existing backend to speak with Zapier directly, so I stopped working on my code and instead moved on to learning the Zapier integration process better and trying to get information to connect <strong><a href=\"https://quickbooks.intuit.com/\">Quickbooks Online</a></strong> and a new CRM that the company is using called <strong><a href=\"https://salespype.com/\">Salespype</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hurdles</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The process has not been smooth. I have a little experience doing work like this, but not as a developer. At my old company, which was an EMR (electronic medical record), I helped with our integrations by mapping out all of our fields (there are thousands) and matching them with fields in other applications that we integrated with. We didn&#8217;t know of Zapier at the time, and I think that around 2010-2012, Zapier might have only just been formed as a company, so they weren&#8217;t an option for us. We relied on a health information interoperability standard called <a href=\"https://www.hl7.org/\"><strong>HL7</strong> </a>to connect with some of our partners, and on custom APIs and integrations with others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the old job, I knew the system inside-and-out. It wasn&#8217;t too hard to determine where data from our application should flow to in other applications, once I was given access to them. At this new company, I&#8217;m running into hurdles. For example, as of this writing, its been a week since Salespype was set up. I was told that within 48 hours, their team would connect our Salespype to Zapier. That didn&#8217;t happen. I was then told that I&#8217;d have an update by that Saturday. That also didn&#8217;t happen. Three days have passed since then (due to Labor Day weekend) and as of this afternoon, I&#8217;ve messaged Salespype three times and still don&#8217;t have an update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal is to see Salespype&#8217;s integration with Zapier so that I can understand what data their API exposes and then match our API to Zapier with the same information. Some of that data will likely also be reproduced when we connect Zapier to Quickbooks Online, so our superset of connected Zapier endpoints will have two subsets: one for Salespype connectivity and one for QBO. Waiting on a response from Salespype has basically already pushed us out almost a week, and its frustrating to the owner, who I Zoom with each day. Its disheartening to give the same report of no progress made several days in a row. Sadly, this is a peril when working with other people or depending on work or information from other companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Monkey in the middle</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, for the first time, I was placed in the unenviable position of being asked to get the development team to provide a tracking list of features and due dates for every feature needed for completion of the current version of the software. Some of this information is already available through checklists, but as many can surmise, due dates can be moving targets. Surprises almost always come up during development and managing them results in ever-expanding deadlines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t want, not do I have the experience, to replace the person who&#8217;s already heading the developers. I don&#8217;t have his understanding of the codebase &#8211; which I haven&#8217;t even fully-explored yet &#8211; and I don&#8217;t want to play good cop/bad cop or anything like that with other human beings. I reviewed one of the checklists that he provided to me a few weeks ago. It shows features that are in some stage of development and has checkmarks for completion of various phases. Right now, there are 14 major features on the list, and the development process has 15 phases. The first 9 features have checkmarks in 1/2 to 3/4 of the boxes. The rest are blank. They&#8217;re also big features. They were supposed to be completed before October 15th, because we&#8217;re going to show the application at a conference in Kentucky towards the end of October. However, we got a surprise announcement that the company is hosting a mini-convention of its own, with contractor companies, around September 25th. So, development lost a month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, it doesn&#8217;t look like we can realistically complete everything that&#8217;s being worked on 4 weeks early. I&#8217;m going to carve out time to meet with the other developers and get a sense of where we are with the features on our list. I don&#8217;t relish the thought of playing bad cop to the development team, so I have to see how to approach this. I prefer to nurture and empower than to command with a whip.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, today I&#8217;m 4 weeks into my first job as a web developer.

got my first programmer job","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/08/17/i-got-my-first-programmer-job/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-zk","content":"\n<p>Last week, on Monday (August 9th), I signed a contract for my first full-time developer position. I started the next day and completed my first week, even though it was only 4 days. Yesterday, I started my first full week. The position is with a landscaping company based out of California. I&#8217;m working on an application that they produce and license to other landscaping and contractor companies. It focuses on making estimates and tracking hours, workers, jobs and all of the numbers that make those things up to determine profitability. I&#8217;m going to blog through this initial period while its still fresh, so hopefully other new developers can gain some insight into what a new developer experience might look like for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Landing the position</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, after 18 intense months, I graduated from Lambda School in April and started looking for work. I had been applying to positions that I came across from time-to-time since I was either in the React or Node units at Lambda, so sometime in the 2nd half of 2020 I was actively seeking work, albeit not with as much effort as I would after graduation. Some of my <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2021/02/12/job-hunt-i-almost-fell-for-a-phishing-attempt/\">earlier posts</a> talk about this a little. Once I graduated, I began to apply much more earnestly, using my own ad hoc internal system to track positions I&#8217;d applied to (hello, Notepad!) and eventually making use of Lambda&#8217;s application tracking program as well. I had an updated resume, I had updated my LinkedIn profile a bit based on programmer &amp; developer advocate <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL54X5yR8qizsMpvTCqUIEFMeEp-chvcxk\">Danny Thompson&#8217;s LinkedIn series</a> and I was working on projects to try and keep my skills up and learn new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I landed a few interviews based on blind outreach, but I was selective, too. I didn&#8217;t apply to hundreds of companies like some others do. I tried to find positions that I thought I was a good match for and wrote a cover letter template that I then customized for each position I applied to. I also started adding people on LinkedIn more actively, and actually took a day to specifically hunt down recruiters and add them on LinkedIn. I had a short introduction that I shared with each of them when I sent a connection request. Ultimately, this outreach didn&#8217;t seem to matter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In what seems to be a more typical process, I learned about the position that I eventually landed through a contact from Lambda on LinkedIn. She posted that she knew of a position available for a developer in South California. Since that&#8217;s where we moved to, I replied to her thread and let her know that I was interested if it was a junior position. She DMed me and asked for my portfolio, GitHub profile and resume, which I sent, along with a link to my online resume and LinkedIn profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in Arizona at the time. My parents were visiting from back home in NY and we drove 7 or 8 hours to an airbnb to visit with one of my sisters and her family. The night after I sent my contact the information she had asked for, someone else messaged me from Lambda&#8217;s Slack. He said that he works with my contact who I had forwarded my information to and wanted to know if we could meet. We ended up having a 2-hour Zoom meeting that ended around 12:30 AM. We&#8217;re both night owls. During the meeting, we went over my work history at the EMR I&#8217;ve been employed at for the past 18 years, as well as a little bit about my 5 years in I/T before that, and some other things (he learned a bit about my love for extreme metal and electric bass, and about my family). What we spoke about the most was my EMR experience though, particularly some of the complexities of system design and planning integrations with other applications (we have a clinical system for nursing homes and had partnered and built interoperability with finance, pharmacy and laboratory programs).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I let him know that during that time, I was not a programmer. I was originally in tech support and then application design, eventually becoming the lead designer for the software after our founder passed from melanoma. His name had been familiar to me, and during the meeting, I learned that he is an instructor at Lambda (I didn&#8217;t have him as a teacher, he taught mainly even-numbered cohorts and I was usually in odd-numbered ones). He also has a web development company with around 16 employees and a bunch of projects. I told him a bit about my own small web development company (which had added a new person the day before my meeting with him). In the span of two days, a lot had happened in Arizona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that was on a Wednesday &amp; Thursday about 3 weeks ago. I told him that I was driving back to CA on Friday and wouldn&#8217;t be available until late. We ended up connecting again the day after I got back and he said that he had spoken with the owner of the company that the job posting was for and that he thought I was a shoo-in. They wanted to arrange a Zoom meeting, which I agreed to. Later that day, I had another 2-hour Zoom with the owner of the company. We got along pretty well, he got a feel for me and my experience and I got a feel for what his company does and what the software did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He sent me some material to review, it was a series of videos that explained parts of his estimating process. Later on in the week, his company sent an IQ test. It was 30 mins long and consisted of 80 questions, all multiple choice. I think I made it through 74 of them before the time ran out. A day or so later, I was sent some more videos as well as a PDF of a 156-page book that he wrote explaining his process for determining if a company is profitable or not, and corrections that could be made to ensure profitability. I read through that book and watched more videos. We Zoomed again close to the end of the week, or during the weekend after my return to CA and walked through the system, with him quizzing me on certain principles and having me do math to show that I was following along and understood the process, which their software is based on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I thought that things went well and messaged both of the Lambda contacts (the one from LinkedIn and the instructor who owns the web dev company) to let them know that and to thank them for the opportunity. The following Monday, I Zoomed with the owner and he made me an offer. I accepted verbally and they sent a contract, which I signed. That takes us to now, which I&#8217;ll detail in the next section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its important to note, as well, that I didn&#8217;t have a technical programming interview for this position. There was no whiteboarding or even a take-home project. Our discussions revolved around my experience and how much coding I had done, which I was honest about &#8211; it was roughly 2 years, and the majority of it had been at Lambda, with other projects being built during my enrollment there and after graduation. They also included talk about salary and other compensation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">My first week</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My first week was only 4 days long, but it was a long 4 days. There&#8217;s a lot to learn. The software I&#8217;ll be working on is being built using React, along with several libraries. There are older versions, from an MS Access one to a Visual Basic one (which we spent a lot of time looking at) to a C# version, to the one I&#8217;ll contribute to. I spent a lot of time reviewing the VB system because it has features that still need to be built for the React version. I also learned about a bunch of other application that the company uses for various purposes. Some are for running the company and marketing and others are for time-tracking and interoperability with other applications.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https://www.activecampaign.com/\">ActiveCampaign</a></li><li><a href=\"https://busybusy.com/\">BusyBusy</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.callrail.com/\">CallRail</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.exaktime.com/\">ExakTime</a></li><li><a href=\"https://unbounce.com/\">Unbounce</a></li><li><a href=\"https://zapier.com/\">Zapier</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I was in a lot of Zooms last week. I met with marketing people, the team who builds websites for the company and its holdings, other developers and office personnel. On Friday, I drove to the office (its about an hour away, with this reduced COVID traffic) and met with a ton of people from all departments. I also attended Zoom meetings from there, on the big screen. What stands out to me the most is meeting a person who I had been briefly introduced to during a Zoom earlier last week. He&#8217;s from Guatamala and has a computer science background from 20 years ago, which places him in my age group. He had learned a bunch of different languages that I&#8217;m not experienced with, including C++, Java, and maybe 4-5 other languages. He has a love for SQL as well. When he came to the US, language was a barrier, so he was unable to land a developer job. He did other things, but has been with this company for a few years now, knows the software, understands programming and can now speak English very well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We spent a bit talking about programming concepts and our experiences and hit it off pretty well. I think he should be on the programming team. He&#8217;s more experienced than I am, even though he doesn&#8217;t know React and hasn&#8217;t worked with JavaScript in years. He said that right now, what he does is something that the owner tasked him specifically to do, and it closes a big money gap for them, but I did give him back the itch to code. We&#8217;ll see what happens in the future&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to learn, and right now, I&#8217;m a overwhelmed. I should actually be focusing on work, but I think I need a small reprieve, hence the timeout to write this blog post. I&#8217;m trying to get up to speed with the program. I need to learn the workflows. I&#8217;ve been reviewing the other programs that the company uses, particularly ActiveCampaign and Zapier. I also have my first big task: build an API to connect the company&#8217;s software to Zapier, so it can then connect with other applications already in the Zapier ecosystem, like QuickBooks and ActiveCampaign. Its a monstrous first task, because I don&#8217;t know the system as well as I&#8217;d like yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I met with one of the other programmers, who is also a Lambda graduate and was in my original WEB23 cohort. Its great working with him, as he was sharp, kind and insightful, even back during Lambda. We talked through some questions and ideas about how to connect with Zapier and looked over the system together. He gave me a good run-down of the entire React application. We chose two components that should be the first to be connected to Zapier, but after reading through their technical documentation yesterday, it looks like we&#8217;re going to have to work on authentication before we start working on the rest of the API. I&#8217;ll probably write a post about that process, to help others, once I&#8217;m far enough in. So far, I&#8217;ve started creating to document the first component we&#8217;re integrating. I listed out all of the fields onscreen, made columns to list the names in the database, data type for each field, constraints and general notes. I also made a document that lists all of the request payloads when working with the local API, which ended up expanding my list of fields to 4 pages of fields that are possibly used, but do not appear onscreen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have access to a bunch of repos on GitHub with code for various applications and websites that the company has built. Earlier today, I was reviewing the backend, which is written in a bunch of languages (C#, JavaScript, TSQL, HTML, CSS and Smalltalk). I&#8217;m trying to learn about additional constraints that the backend code places on all of the fields I listed in my document. I think later today, the lead developer will meet with me to review the database schema, which should answer a lot of my questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been meeting with the owner via Zoom every morning at 7:30, to give him a short status update and to make sure I&#8217;m doing ok. Its also how I ended up with meatier first-tasks, like this API. At our meeting this morning, he informed me that we can now stop or reduce the frequency of these early AM meetings, as I&#8217;m working on a project and apparently give off the appearance that I know what I&#8217;m doing. Later today, I have meetings with various team members and two other companies. One is with ActiveCampaign and the people who build the company&#8217;s websites and the other is with BusyBusy, the programming team and the lead business person. Actually, that first meeting is in less than an hour, so I&#8217;m going to wrap up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, also, I&#8217;ve been working on small projects to try and help learn the company&#8217;s application. Last week, I built out a Next.js website and converted some of the documentation for the VB version of the software from Word format to the web. I&#8217;m only about 25% through though. After I have all of the content up and I&#8217;ve refined it (its ugly) then I&#8217;ll share it back with the owner so that others can use it as a quick reference tool or for the same kind of training I&#8217;m undergoing. Its a good way to learn the system and produce something at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also looked over the repos for some of the websites and for the application. I have a lot of ramping up to do before I can contribute to any of those. They&#8217;re using a few libraries I haven&#8217;t seen before and things I&#8217;m not to great with, like Material UI. The repos that are in languages which I haven&#8217;t learned are also out there, waiting to unravel my mind. And I created a Trello board to organize the Zapier integration, as well as some other things in my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s basically the first 5-6 days thus far. I&#8217;ll update again. Oh &#8211; and I haven&#8217;t announced anything about this position yet on LinkedIn or in the Hired channel at Lambda. I&#8217;m waiting a few weeks to see if I sink or swim before I add this and let the world-at-large as it exists on the internet know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last week, on Monday (August 9th), I signed a contract for my first full-time developer position.

a GoDaddy domain to a Netlify website","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/07/06/connect-a-godaddy-domain-to-a-netlify-website/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-yT","content":"\n<p>I haven&#8217;t made time to blog since April (so two months and maybe two weeks have passed) due to a lot of big life changes, but I wanted to share a process I just used to host a site on <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\"><strong>Netlify</strong> </a>while its registered at <strong><a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/\">GoDaddy</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Those of you who follow my blog know that I built a website for a cancer charity called <strong><a href=\"https://www.breastcancercomfort.org/\">Breast Cancer Comfort</a></strong>. They originally had a <strong>WordPress </strong>website that was largely incomplete. I drafted a new site for them using HTML &amp; CSS and showed it to their founder via Facebook back at the end of 2019 and she loved it. I told her they could have it for free, because I support their mission. I had planned on rebuilding it with <strong>React</strong>, but their marketing director at the time asked if I could rebuild it using WordPress and a drag-and-drop editor called <strong>Divi</strong>, because he wanted it to be updateable by others if I wasn&#8217;t available. I learned Divi and did so, but (1) no one else made any updates to the site except for me and (2) the marketing director had his first baby and left, leaving me with Divi and a slow-to-load WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>About a year after my initial draft of the BCC site, I was experimenting with <strong>Next.js</strong> and found that I loved it. I decided to rebuild the site using Next.js, instead of just React. Development was rapid and I had it completed in a matter of days. Its missing one component though: <em>ecommerce</em>. We want a shop on the website, and I personally don&#8217;t want it to be external. I don&#8217;t want to link out to an Etsy shop, or an external Shopify one. I&#8217;m currently experimenting with different ecommerce options to see what I can integrate into the existing website. But, in the meantime &#8211; since I have a working website, I made time earlier today and backed up all of the media from the WordPress site (there were 2,992 images!) and puzzled out how to use the organization&#8217;s <strong>GoDaddy</strong> domain with the site I had published on <strong>Netlify</strong>. So, to put it in terms web developers are more used to, GoDaddy is the site&#8217;s registrar and DNS provider and Netlify is the host. Here&#8217;s what I did:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1:</strong> Log into Netlify and go to the <strong>Sites</strong> section (in the top menu) and click on the website that you want to connect with GoDaddy&#8217;s DNS. In the <strong>Site Overview</strong> tab, click on the <strong>Site Settings</strong> button and then <strong>Domain management</strong> in the left pane. Click the <strong>Add custom domain</strong> button.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"549\" data-attachment-id=\"2170\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/netlify-godaddy-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1030\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"netlify-godaddy-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2170\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-01.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2:</strong> In the form, enter the URL of the site. It should include &#8220;www&#8221; and match the URL from GoDaddy. For example, if your domain is &#8220;www.imarealwebdevnow.com&#8221; then enter that (but not the quotation marks). A question will appear, asking if you own the domain. Select &#8220;yes&#8221; to confirm.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"549\" data-attachment-id=\"2171\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/netlify-godaddy-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1030\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"netlify-godaddy-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2171\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-02.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3:</strong> <strong>Custom domains</strong> will now show two new entries, the domain that you entered, and the same domain name, but without the &#8220;www&#8221; prefix.

I can&#8217;t remember if I clicked on <strong>Options</strong> in the <strong>primary domain</strong> selection above or if the next dialogue just popped up, because too much time has passed, but you&#8217;ll get the following screen. The important thing here is to copy the <strong>CNAME</strong> that&#8217;s listed (its a URL). You don&#8217;t need the trailing period. You&#8217;re going to paste this into the DNS settings at GoDaddy. Its the name of the deploy at Netlify, so you&#8217;re essentially forwarding requests from the URL at GoDaddy to the domain name at Netlify.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"549\" data-attachment-id=\"2175\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/netlify-godaddy-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1030\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"netlify-godaddy-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2175\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-04.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>5<strong>:</strong> Log into your GoDaddy account, scroll down to <strong>All Products and Services</strong> and click on <strong>DNS</strong> for the domain that you want to link to Netlify.

Now you need to wait for the changes to propagate out across the internet. It might happen almost immediately, or it might take from 24-48 hours for the changes to reach your ISP&#8217;s DNS servers. Open the website&#8217;s URL in your browser from time-to-time and check to see when the change has reached your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I did have to scroll down to the bottom of the <strong>Domain management</strong> screen for the website on Netlify and click <strong>Verify DNS configuration</strong> in order to get the <strong>TLS/SSL certificate</strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/\">Let&#8217;s Encrypt</a></strong>. It didn&#8217;t happen immediately, it took a few minutes for the process to complete. Netlify still has to apply it to the BCC website. If it doesn&#8217;t happen by tomorrow, I&#8217;ll update with a post detailing next steps, which will walk through providing a certificate from Let&#8217;s Encrypt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Update (2021.07.07)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometime overnight, the HTTPS certificate from Let&#8217;s Encrypt did process and attach, so the website is now secure.

Things are moving forward. At the beginning of the month &#8211; on April Fool&#8217;s Day, no less &#8211; I graduated from <strong>Lambda School</strong>. It was a long process, and I haven&#8217;t documented all of it yet, but I plan to as time permits. This is my post from LinkedIn, which shows my certificate:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"566\" height=\"814\" data-attachment-id=\"2150\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/lambda-grad/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"566,814\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"lambda-grad\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg?w=209\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg?w=566\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg?w=566\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2150\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg 566w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg?w=104 104w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/lambda-grad.jpg?w=209 209w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 566px) 100vw, 566px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Since graduating, I&#8217;ve been moved into the job hunt segment of the program. There are daily Zooms which focus on career-related skills and insights, networking activities, online resources for applying to and tracking progress with developer positions and more. I&#8217;ve split my time between some of these activities as well as building projects and I also recently started reviewing my JavaScript via <strong>Web Dev Simplified&#8217;s <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://javascriptsimplified.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript Simplified</a></strong> course. I&#8217;m about halfway through the basic package (its about 75 videos, some of which are an hour long each) and plan on moving onto the complete course later on. I think that adds on around 70 more lessons. I also grabbed <strong>Brad Traversy</strong>&#8216;s new <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/nextjs-dev-to-deployment/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Next.js</strong> <strong>course</strong></a>, because I&#8217;ve been building with Next.js and really enjoy using it. I&#8217;m sure the course will cover features that I&#8217;m not fully utilizing and can&#8217;t wait to dig into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JavaScript Simplified has been a great refresher, so far, and moving at my own pace has been a lot more manageable than learning at Lambda&#8217;s pace was. I think it helps that I went through Lambda, because I understand a lot of the concepts in JavaScript Simplified already. Its given me a better understanding about certain topics though, like closures and pointing to data by reference vs. value. I&#8217;m excited to see how Kyle from WDS simplifies more advanced topics, and I&#8217;m excited to build projects with a stronger foundation in JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Iconic Web Studios</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I mentioned at the end of December that I was starting a web development company, in addition to looking for full-time work as a developer. In January, I did so. I formed an LLC and created <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://iconicweb.dev/\" target=\"_blank\">Iconic Web Studios</a></strong>. My intention was to start looking for clients to build websites for in February, but at the time, I was still finishing Lambda and had started Labs, which is the final group project that we work on. Labs ended up dominating most of my time, so I was forced to move more slowly with Iconic. I ended up adding 3 other developers to my team, two of whom are Lambda graduates and one who is in the middle of the curriculum right now. There are 6 more who want to join, but I&#8217;m holding off for now so that things don&#8217;t balloon past my ability to control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, its fun working with a team as well as working solo. I&#8217;ve been advising two of my teammates with projects they&#8217;re working on. One of them is building with Next.js for the first time, after I helped him to get set up. His project is a website for a company that produces Raspberry Pi projects and kits. Another already had a job at a cryptocurrency company. She&#8217;s been working with VueX and Tailwind since last fall. She took on a project to build a website for a market by where she lives that&#8217;s been family-owned for 3 generations. I think its been in their community for 70 years. She&#8217;s doing it using React and is getting back up to speed with it after using VueX for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its been interesting working with this group. I&#8217;m mentoring two of them and advising the third person (the VueX developer). Seeing people who have graduated Lambda operate at different levels of confidence and proficiency is an insightful experience. Its interesting to see how our skills have all diverged as well. The person who works with VueX is using a different stack from what we learned at boot camp. Through her experience, I&#8217;ve gotten curious about Vue and Vuex. I plan on learning them sometime in the next few months. She likes it more than React, finding it simpler and finding their implementation of state management easier to work with. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The person who&#8217;s working on the Raspberry Pi site has had a harder time revving back up. His design skills are strong and his portfolio really showcases that. His background is more in design and even photography and videography. He makes his own SVGs using Photoshop &#8211; when I was using Photoshop more, it was raster-based. It didn&#8217;t support vector graphics. I didn&#8217;t know that new versions do. I actually grabbed Inkscape in January to learn how to make vector graphics, but haven&#8217;t gotten to dig into it yet because I&#8217;ve been more focused on coding. I find it interesting that he reaches for libraries before trying to code out features for himself. I take the opposite approach. He also builds by coming up with a layout first. I also take a different approach here. I&#8217;m very content-driven. I plan my projects around available and planned content. After I know what&#8217;s going on each page or in each component, then I do the design for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third person, who is still going through Lambda, looks like she&#8217;s going to be a strong developer, to me. She has a good understanding of accessibility (so does the VueX person, actually) and tackles projects head-on. She&#8217;s working with another group of Lambda students who are making games with Unity and donating the proceeds to charities. She showed me one of the websites she&#8217;s building for a game they&#8217;re working on and it has a lot of promise. I also know some of her team there, because they were in other cohorts with me and in some other groups I&#8217;m either in or helped start. They have strong work ethic and are personable and helpful, so she&#8217;s in good company with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"556\" data-attachment-id=\"2069\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/iconic-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1349,733\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iconic-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2069\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Breast Cancer Comfort</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I rebuilt the website for<strong> Breast Cancer Comfort</strong> right after I graduated Lambda, this time using Next.js. There&#8217;s one piece left that I&#8217;m sorting through &#8211; ecommerce. Once I have a storefront embedded into the website, I&#8217;ll make it live and it will replace the existing WordPress/Divi one. I&#8217;ll be happy to have that done. I&#8217;ve said before that I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of Divi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, I&#8217;ve experimented with <strong>Shopify&#8217;s Buy Button</strong> and their <strong>StoreFront API</strong>. I&#8217;ve looked at <strong>Stripe</strong> and <strong>Square</strong>, and I briefly reviewed <strong>BigCommerce</strong> and <strong>Magento</strong>. I looked at <strong>Commerce</strong> from Next.js and a few JavaScript and React libraries as well. I haven&#8217;t made a decision as to which way to go yet, and there are a bunch of other technologies I looked into that I can&#8217;t remember the names of. My main goal is to integrate a storefront into the existing website, so visitors don&#8217;t need to use an external site to shop. I worry a lot about security around shopping carts, so that&#8217;s a significant feature in my search as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also removed <strong>Comfort Connections</strong> from the BCC website in the rebuilt version. I&#8217;d like to spin it off into its own site and own project. Its the work of one of the interns (who is currently studying medicine at Harvard!) and although it has overlap with BCC, it comes from a different place and can grow better and have a stronger identity independent of the organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The developer who is still going through the Lambda curriculum is also interested in joining me at BCC. I let the team there know about this and they&#8217;re happy to have her. She would be joining in a marketing and social media management capacity, if schedules mesh. She currently handles these tasks for the game development group she&#8217;s part of, as well as being their treasurer. In 2 weeks, during out next BCC meeting, I&#8217;ll see if I can get us all connected so we can meet and iron out details. It&#8217;ll also give her time to get through her first build week at Lambda as a React developer!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"728\" data-attachment-id=\"2156\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/bcc-v2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,728\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-v2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2156\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/bcc-v2.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Baltimore Corps</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I have a new project starting on April 26th and going on for 2 weeks. I landed a contract to build out a website for an application that <strong><a href=\"https://www.baltimorecorps.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Baltimore Corps</a></strong> is developing. I can&#8217;t talk more about it yet, because of the contract that I signed, but it looks to be a fun project and they have more work that needs to be done, both on their website and with some applications that are in development, so this could potentially turn into a longer-running contract or series of contracts. I&#8217;m excited for it.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a minute since I&#8217;ve had time to write. Things are moving forward.

Its a period in which I work with a team to build a project for a stakeholder. We go through the process of creating user stories, user flows, wireframes and other planning exercises. There are stages for technical decisions in which we research and plan out the technologies we&#8217;re going to use for our project, taking note of benefits and risks of chosen technologies, challenges we foresee using those technologies and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later on the process will focus on other aspects of working with a team, including demonstrating contribution to a project, giving and receiving feedback and presenting our work. I&#8217;m only in the first phase, so it was a lot of the planning and now initial building, as well as focus on GitHub &#8211; not just the technical aspects of using it, but communicating with other developers, properly writing comments on commits and pull requests, and generally using GitHub to meaningfully convey information about the purpose of a given commit or pull request that we make, as well as being the review for someone else&#8217;s GitHub activity and how to best communicate with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project I&#8217;m working on is called <strong>Express Pet Groomer</strong>. Its a <em>build-on</em>, which means that we&#8217;re continuing a project that another team worked on before us. The opposite of that is a <em>greenfield</em> project, which is a new one, which would need to be designed from scratch. Dealing with someone else&#8217;s technical decisions is an interesting endeavor. Its the situation that most developers will find themselves in throughout their careers, from my understanding. We don&#8217;t necessarily all work for start-ups and build a project from its conception &#8211; most of the time, we&#8217;re joining a company with an existing project or set of projects and have to acclimate to its codebase, technologies and workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"494\" data-attachment-id=\"2138\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/elephantsql-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1140,551\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"elephantsql-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2138\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-1.jpg 1140w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">ElephantSQL</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, the purpose of this article is to introduce <strong><a href=\"https://www.elephantsql.com/\">ElephantSQL</a></strong>, a tool that I think will be useful for other beginner developers. During setup for our back-end, we had to get <strong><a href=\"https://www.postgresql.org/\">PostgreSQL</a></strong> set up. The three options that the previous team suggested in the documentation were (1) using <strong><a href=\"https://www.docker.com/\">Docker</a></strong>, (2) downloading and installing PostgreSQL locally and (3) setting up a free account with ElephantSQL.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read through some of Docker&#8217;s <strong><a href=\"https://docs.docker.com/\">documentation</a></strong> and a nice overview from <strong><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/docker-simplified-96639a35ff36/\">freeCodeCamp</a></strong>. The technology is intriguing to me, because my background is in I/T and networking, but I haven&#8217;t had to do that kind of work in a while since I&#8217;ve been focusing mainly on application design for our EMR. I&#8217;m used to virtual machines and server sessions, but containerization is new to me. I intend to explore this in much more depth after Labs, when I can carve out time without the worry of slowing down my team.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https://devopscon.io/blog/docker/docker-vs-virtual-machine-where-are-the-differences/\"><strong>DOCKER VS. VIRTUAL MACHINE: WHERE ARE THE DIFFERENCES?</strong></a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Downloading and setting up PostgreSQL was also something I considered, but its nothing new. So, I decided to try out ElephantSQL. The steps seemed to be the most brief, and I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up having the database set up within 5 minutes. Most of that process was just me looking over ElephantSQL for the first time. The actual process of setting up a free database as a service with them was very fast &#8211; just create an account, create an instance and pass the provided URL into your application&#8217;s configuration (in my case, the .env file).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m using the free &#8220;Tiny Turtle&#8221; plan, which allows up to 20MB of data and 5 concurrent connections. There are 4 plans for shared instances, 6 plans for dedicated instances and 6 plans for dedicated instances with &#8220;follower&#8221;, which is basically fault tolerance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I had the URL from ElephantSQL set in my .env, I used <strong>knex</strong> to quickly migrate the latest starting schema and seed the database with data. I then tested my logins and looked at the application for the first time (our team didn&#8217;t have the environment variables and passwords to do all of this previously) and everything ran. It was a buttery smooth process that I&#8217;ll likely use again for small projects in the future. If you&#8217;re building small CRUD applications for a portfolio, or for proof-of-concept projects, ElephantSQL seems like a really fast and easy way to connect them to a database.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"973\" data-attachment-id=\"2139\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/elephantsql-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1100,1046\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"elephantsql-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2139\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/elephantsql-2.jpg 1100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, at Lambda I&#8217;m in Labs now.

Some of them ended up linking out to <strong>LinkedIn</strong>, and used their system for applying. On Monday, I received an email regarding one of those positions. It included references to what I&#8217;d applied for, and in the morning hours, with kids running around, it looked legitimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"696\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2107\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/phishing-email/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"804,1183\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"phishing-email\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=204\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=696\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=696\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2107\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=696 696w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=102 102w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=204 204w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-email.jpg 804w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The email instructed me to reach out via email and Skype to schedule a screening interview. The window was Monday and Tuesday between 10AM &#8211; 5PM, It was already around 11AM on Monday, so I immediately reached out to the person specified in the message on both Skype and through email. I was shortly afterwards in a Skype &#8216;interview&#8217; that gobbled up 3 hours of my day before I realized it was a scam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m attaching the email I received, so others can compare it with email that they receive, a screenshot of the opening Skype chat, and (although lengthy) a transcript of the 3-hour chat. The chat is just there in case anyone wants to see the questions that I was asked, and how I garbled my way through it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the chat, at 3:07, when I said that an email had been sent, it hadn&#8217;t. I had realized by then that this was a phishing attempt and wanted to see what the &#8216;interviewer&#8217; would say if I said I had emailed but they received nothing. It was as expected. They asked for the same info in chat to &#8216;confirm&#8217; what was sent.  They wanted my full name, home address, phone number and email to start. I&#8217;m sure that once that was sent, they&#8217;d follow up asking for bank account info or something else so they could send me the alleged funds they had waiting for a home office, and so on. They&#8217;re just trying to get more info in stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"875\" data-attachment-id=\"2108\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/phishing-chat/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1077,921\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"phishing-chat\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2108\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/phishing-chat.jpg 1077w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Its interesting to note that prior to responding, I Googled the person who emailed me and the person who I was supposed to email back, and found both of them on the company&#8217;s website.

add email to contact forms with Netlify","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/01/29/easily-add-email-to-contact-forms-with-netlify/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-xu","content":"\n<p>I was adding email functionality to the contact form on one of my websites earlier today. The site was built with <strong>Next.js</strong>, so I built out a backend for it with <strong>Node</strong> and <strong>Express</strong> and included a library called <strong>Nodemailer</strong> for SMTP messaging. It had some errors that were taking me a while to figure out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up taking a break and showering. When I returned, I did a search for alternate means to add email functionality to forms on a website. I know that generally, it can&#8217;t be done from the frontend. You need a backend to actually send out the email. Well, this is still true, but <strong>Netlify</strong> actually provides a free service that essentially gives websites deployed there a backend for forms and email!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also amazingly easy to set up. There are two variations that I tried. The first is for a pure static HTML website. The second is for a site built using JavaScript, so React, Next, Vue, Angular, etc.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"method-1-html\">Method 1: HTML</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Add the following attributes to the &lt;form&gt; tag in your HTML: <strong>method=&#8217;POST&#8217;</strong> <strong>data-netlify=&#8217;true&#8217;</strong>. That&#8217;s it. You&#8217;re all set. Make sure that the form has a <strong>name</strong> attribute, so Netlify knows what to call it and that the form fields have name attributes as well so that their data can be captured. The form&#8217;s name attribute is also necessary for the case of distinguishing forms if there is more than one form on a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;form name=\"contact\" method=\"POST\" data-netlify=\"true\"&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"method-2-javascript\">Method 2: JavaScript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a JavaScript-based site that&#8217;s rendered on the client instead of the server (React, Next.js, etc.) the process is twice as long &#8211; so its two steps. Add the attributes from above to your form&#8217;s opening tag, just like the HTML method. Then, add the following line of code right below the &lt;form&gt; tag:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;input type='hidden' name='form-name' value='contact-form' /&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s it. Make sure that &#8216;value&#8217; is set to the name of your form. For example, mine was <strong>value=&#8217;contact-form</strong>&#8216; because my form had the attribute <strong>name=&#8217;contact-form&#8217;</strong>. If your form has labels, you&#8217;ll need to change the &#8216;for&#8217; attribute to &#8216;<strong>htmlFor</strong>&#8216;, but that&#8217;s just standard JavaScript since &#8216;for&#8217; is a reserved word. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, if you&#8217;re using Next.js to build your site, remember to include these in the site&#8217;s build settings on Netlify:<br>Build command: <strong>next build &amp;&amp; next export</strong><br>Publish directory: <strong>out</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"viewing-messages-sending-email\">Viewing messages / Sending email</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you&#8217;re all set up and your site is deployed, you can test by just completing your contact form and submitting it. Netlify will show a modal that confirms for the viewer that the message was sent and offer a link to return to the site. You can customize the modal, but I haven&#8217;t done that yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can then go to the dashboard for your site, refresh the page and on the bottom-left, you&#8217;ll see a section for <strong>submissions</strong>, with a list of received messages. Just click on one to expand it and read its contents. What&#8217;s even more amazing is that at the top of the screen by Site Overview, if you click on Forms and the on Settings and Usage, you can scroll down to Form Notifications and add different notifications, including email. You can then enter an email address and whenever a contact form is submitted, it will appear in the dashboard <em>and</em> get emailed to that address. For free. For 1-2 lines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free tier allows up to 100 submissions per month. After that, there are other tiers that handle larger quantities of messages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"videos\">Videos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the two videos I watched that really explained the process well. The first is from <strong>Brad Traversy,</strong> which works fine for static/HTML sites. The second is from <strong>Colby Fayock</strong>, which covered the Next.js requirements. Ok. I&#8217;m going to add contact forms to all of my sites now. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ElQ689HRcY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GLxgxnLTVLE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong><a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/?_ga=2.174809314.1387181091.1611901568-1644887687.1611111028\">Netlify documentation: Forms setup</a></strong></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I was adding email functionality to the contact form on one of my websites earlier today.

I already formed an LLC at the beginning of the year for it and got the federal, state and city stuff taken care of, so I&#8217;m good to go, legally. I had planned on launching and looking for clients this month, but pushed it to February because I wanted to try different website designs first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up going through the Next.js documentation on their website again and wrote out a procedure for building a website with the framework. Its a series of Markdown files that go over different processes like setting up the project, routing, styling and so on. I used that to guide my work on v2 of the website.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery columns-2 is-cropped wp-block-gallery-1 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"466\" data-attachment-id=\"1955\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/iconic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1349,614\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iconic-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"1955\" class=\"wp-image-1955\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">version 1</figcaption></figure></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"556\" data-attachment-id=\"2069\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/iconic-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1349,733\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iconic-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" data-id=\"2069\" class=\"wp-image-2069\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/iconic-2.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><figcaption class=\"blocks-gallery-item__caption\">version 2</figcaption></figure></li></ul></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, two days ago, <strong>Brad Traversy</strong> released a 2021 update to his <strong>Next.js Crash Course</strong>. The original is now 3 years old, and the timing was perfect. I had enough experience with Next that I could understand everything that he was doing, and I picked up a few ideas I want to try with global components. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also decided to not just solo the mission this time around. While I haven&#8217;t brought in any help yet, I posted about the project in Slack at Lambda and a few people have reached out to say that they&#8217;re interested in working on it with me. My hope is to assemble a team that I can depend on so that we can level up our basic web development skills while we job hunt and also build a client base. I&#8217;m almost done with the rebuild of the site. My aim is to show it to the people who are interested and see if they have any suggestions for improvement, or even if they want to have a go at a complete redesign. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m going to try landing a client in February. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, here&#8217;s Brad&#8217;s revised Next.js course. Its a great walkthrough. I saw that <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9g9gP2onazU5-2M-AzA8eBw\">The Net Ninja</a></strong> is also working on something, so I have to check that out&#8230; next.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mTz0GXj8NN0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, in December I mentioned that I was building a website using Next.js over the winter break.

of other things, but I&#8217;ve been trying to carve out time to explore little code techniques that catch my eye. One of these is <strong>parallax scroll effects.</strong> Its the effect we see on some websites in which a user can scroll on a page and text or other elements scroll up or down the screen while the background stays in place. In some cases, the background will move with the other elements, but at a different pace or after a certain element has started moving. Then, when it moves past, a different background image scrolls in to take its place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out, a lot of this can be done using the &#8220;<strong>background-attachment: fixed;</strong>&#8221; style in CSS on a background element.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the page from w3schools that I used as a template to begin experimenting:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp\">w3schools: How to create a parallax scrolling effect</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"734\" data-attachment-id=\"2057\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/parallax-scroll-effect/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1129,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"parallax-scroll-effect\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2057\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/parallax-scroll-effect.jpg 1129w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the tests I did in CodePen. The first one basically mimics w3schools, and the others are slight variants.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/VwKqrya\">parallax &#8211; 100vh</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/eYdbeLo\">parallax &#8211; 50vh</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/WNGLXYy\">parallax &#8211; centered text</a></strong></li><li><strong><a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/wvzRpvX\">parallax &#8211; multiple images</a></strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one (100vh) shows a background image at full viewport height and a tall div that can be used to scroll and demonstrate that the background stays in place. The second one (50vh) takes that same image and shows it at half-height, because I was curious about how it would look and how it would affect positioning of elements that came after it. The third one (centered text) includes text with no visible background that can be scrolled over the fixed background, and the last one (multiple images) brings up another background image after the height of the first one has been scrolled. That last one is what had caught my eye on a lot of other websites, as well as the text with transparent background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There might be other ways to do achieve this effect using z-index or other techniques. At some point I&#8217;ll look into these as well (to see if I&#8217;m right about this assumption). In the meantime, I want to add this to some of my existing projects, and use it on some upcoming ones.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I know I&#8217;m late to the game with this, as well as a ton of other things, but I&#8217;ve been trying to carve out time to explore little code techniques that catch my eye.

I also grabbed a new laptop over the weekend. Its an Acer Aspire A515 with a Ryzen-5 3500U, Radeon Vega card, 8GB of RAM and a 250GB solid state hard drive. Its nothing monstrous, but its still so much faster than my old desktop and the laptop I&#8217;ve been using. They&#8217;re both older generation Core i5&#8217;s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This morning, I cloned some projects from GitHub that I was working on with the older machines. I was amazed. When I ran &#8216;npm install&#8217; to install dependencies, they came down and installed in about 3 minutes. With the laptop, the node modules alone used to take close to 7, and with the desktop, setting up any React project took around 20 mins to grab dependencies. It put such a smile on my face. 😉</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-attachment-id=\"2044\"

resume &amp; design experiments","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/01/16/updated-resume-design-experiments/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-wy","content":"\n<p>So, on Tuesday night I took a break from Python, Next.js, coding challenges and data structures &amp; algorithms and built out a revised resume in nothing but plain HTML &amp; CSS. I used it as an exercise so I could experiment with some of the stuff that had caught my interest last week &#8211; HTML <strong>details</strong> &amp; <strong>summary</strong> elements, CSS <strong>outline-offset</strong> and <strong>fluid typography</strong> (basically responsive fonts).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me a few hours to get things done, but the project was fun and I got to remember why I like reusable components so much &#8211; repeating my code with HTML made me itchy to just pivot to at least JavaScript and write something more DRY out, but I resisted and made myself do it the more tedious way.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>I really like <strong>details &amp; summary</strong>. After using it, I can see a bunch of different applications for it, from just the informational FAQ-type implementation that I used on the resume to menus and (with some CSS finagling for styling) even building out interfaces with cards that are actually summary elements. I plan on testing this out more in the future.</li><li><strong>Outline-offset</strong> offers a nice option for styling elements without affecting layout. I went really basic, but by styling the outline, and even combining it with transforms or transitions, I think it can liven up interactive parts of a website really well. Offering responses to interactions and generally just keeping the user oriented are important to me, so I like having an extra tool at hand to help with that.</li><li><strong>Fluid typography</strong> is nice to look at. I wasted too much time playing with page widths because of this. I still did couple it with media queries and breakpoints to force different base font sizes before applying view-width modifiers to fonts, but together they made it so that I really didn&#8217;t need to do very much at all to make the resume responsive. Letting css-grid or flexbox handle layout and just populating containers with responsive images and text is how I&#8217;m going to build most of my projects going forward.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"724\" data-attachment-id=\"2023\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/resume-v2-shot/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1317,932\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"resume-v2-shot\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2023\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/resume-v2-shot.jpg 1317w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m messing with <strong>irregularly-shaped elements</strong> now. I had started doing that a bit a few weeks ago, and I finally sat and played around with <strong>parallax scroll effects</strong> a bit last night, so I&#8217;m looking forward to adding those to projects. I keep thinking that I might enjoy design more than development, at least with regard to front-end, but I&#8217;m not really a designer by any stretch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, I have what I need from the federal, state and city governments now, so I should be able to start looking for clients for the web design company I started at the beginning of the year. I want to revise all of the copy on the site, and then I&#8217;ll begin figuring out how to get clients and build websites. I&#8217;m doing everything in my power to course-correct the train-wreck that 2020 was. I hope everyone else out there is making progress too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://vish213.netlify.app/\">Here&#8217;s a link to a deployed version of my resume on Netlify.</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, on Tuesday night I took a break from Python, Next.js, coding challenges and data structures &amp; algorithms and built out a revised resume in nothing but plain HTML &amp; CSS.

Typography","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/01/08/fluid-typography/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-w8","content":"\n<p>I&#8217;ve been thinking about font sizes that scale responsively. We already know how to do this pretty handily to elements &amp; containers and images using width and rems or percentages or vh/vw units. Today, I learned that the term for this is <strong>fluid typography</strong>. I saw some crazy formulas, but also a nice, easy one that just uses a base rem and adds a vw number to it. Here they are, with some videos I watched:</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The easy way:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>font-size: calc(.9rem + 1vw);</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This basically just sets the font-size of an element to a fraction of a rem (a rem generally starts at 16px, which is the default size of a character in most browsers) and adds a percentage to the size using view width. So, in the example above, our font starts with a base size of .9rem (slightly less than a default of 1rem) and adds a percent of the screen&#8217;s width to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sure we can set breakpoints with a specific minimum font-size and a specific maximum font-size to make sure that text never shrinks or grows past a certain amount, to ensure readability. There are some functions like clamp, and some other formulas that can handle this as well, but I don&#8217;t know if clamp is fully-supported across all browsers yet, and I tend to prefer simple solutions over complex formulas.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KvwR9Ti1p5s?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">The harder way:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t tried these formulas yet, but perusing YouTube contents left me with this example:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>body { font-size: calc(14px + (26 - 14) * ((100vw - 300px) / (1600 - 300))); }</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A commentor in that thread explained it like this: <em>This formula is for fluid typography &#8211; basically it&#8217;s a better alternative to the media query breakpoint method (the text will change size fluidly from 14 to 26 px on windows between 300 and 1600 px width)</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a different video, someone else shared the following formula, which is what the above example uses:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>font-size: calc(min-font-size + (max-font-size - min-font-size) * (100vw - min-screen-size) / (max-screen-size - min-screen-size));</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I might have used something like this in a project sometime in the past year-and-a-half, but I didn&#8217;t understand the formula than.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Using only vw</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first video I watched, which only uses vw, with no base to add it to. My concern with this is that there&#8217;s no default/starting size. Its always a percentage of the screen width, which makes me worry about the text being illegible on really small screens because there&#8217;s no forced minimum. Like the first example, up top, we can use breakpoints to set a min and max font-size, but I worry about all of the in-betweens.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yEhXwObrrrg?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">CSS-Tricks</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS-Tricks also had an article exploring it.

for the past few days, mainly to clear my head from all of the coding challenges we&#8217;re doing at Lambda with Python on CodeSignal. Over the past two weeks, we went over array &amp; string manipulation, linked lists (singly, doubly and circular), queues, stacks, searching and recursion. This also included time &amp; space complexity for each data structure&#8217;s basic operations and things like linear search vs binary search, among other things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its my 2nd time going through this, because of not having my photo ID to take the GCA test last time around, so I was automatically forced to repeat the unit (its called flexing). This week, Lambda announced that the GCA is no longer going to be a requirement for passing the unit, but it will be a requirement for graduation. So, I actually should be in Labs right now, not repeating data structures &amp; algorithms, but even though I don&#8217;t love this part of the curriculum, I can see how being exposed to it again is useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, with that out of the way, <strong>Kevin Powell</strong> released another video yesterday. It was about controlling the positioning of background images with CSS. Like his other videos, its fantastic. This is his chapter list:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=0s\">00:00</a> &#8211; Introduction <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=67s\">01:07</a> &#8211; background-image basics <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=128s\">02:08</a> &#8211; background-repeat and size <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=229s\">03:49</a> &#8211; background-position with units <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=311s\">05:11</a> &#8211; background-position with keywords <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=346s\">05:46</a> &#8211; keywords with offsets <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=447s\">07:27</a> &#8211; controlling multiple background images<br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=554s\">09:14</a> &#8211; background-size: cover <br><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T_Jy1CqH9k&amp;t=974s\">16:14</a> &#8211; outro</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the positioning lesson, which cleared up a lot of questions for me, it showed some really interesting things that I was aware of but didn&#8217;t know how to work with &#8211; having multiple background images in a container and using CSS selectors that grab elements that start with a certain sequence of letters. I was approximating the latter by using two classes on some of my elements, or a class and an ID, but this was cuts down on code.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3T_Jy1CqH9k?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve been on something of a CSS/design kick for the past few days, mainly to clear my head from all of the coding challenges we&#8217;re doing at Lambda with Python on CodeSignal.

Its a <strong>CodeSignal</strong> test. We were told that we&#8217;ll be on camera, have to be alone, have to show photo ID and can&#8217;t use Google to help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We learned about the test a few weeks before the end of the CS unit. We were told to try and take it 2 weeks before the end of the unit so that we don&#8217;t have to worry about passing it and also passing the final sprint challenge for CS in the same week. If we fail, there&#8217;s a 2-week cool-down period before we can reattempt it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tried to take it in the middle of October, when we learned about it. That&#8217;s when I discovered that I no longer have a valid photo ID. My license, from New York, is missing. I searched the house, the car and called the only two places I&#8217;d been to and actually set foot inside of in that time period &#8211; Costco and a supermarket chain here in California called Albertson&#8217;s. It didn&#8217;t turn up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ended up ordering a replacement license from the NYS DMV. It cost $17.50 and was supposed to arrive at our old house back home in 2 weeks. It never did, and I didn&#8217;t end up taking the GCA. I reached out to Frontdesk at Lambda when I learned about the photo ID requirement and didn&#8217;t hear back from them. It turned out that they had emailed my Lambda account, which I didn&#8217;t even remember having because I never use it. I ended up seeing the email weeks later. I think it was in mid-November. It was disheartening. The changes were so new that Student Success&#8217; reply to me was basically, &#8220;What&#8217;s a GCA?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"974\" height=\"604\" data-attachment-id=\"1940\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/ack/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"974,604\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ack-\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=974\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=974\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1940\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg 974w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ack-.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 974px) 100vw, 974px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I &#8216;failed&#8217; Computer Science. I passed all of the sprints and each of the sprint challenges &#8211; some were by the skin of my teeth though. Because of this new requirement, and my discovery that I couldn&#8217;t take the test, I&#8217;m now in the middle of my 2nd go through the CS curriculum. Most of my cohort is here with me, as is another cohort that had previously completed Labs and was now moving into CS. I think they&#8217;re the last cohort to go through the old curriculum, and the general consensus is that the old curriculum was stronger. It was more detailed and there were projects and build weeks and team leads &#8211; all things that were removed from the new format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This second attempt has been smoother than the first one. My head is a jumble though, because I&#8217;m now in a cohort with people from different places in my build weeks. Some students were ahead of me, some were behind me, some I&#8217;ve been in actual cohorts with, not just build week teams. Its one big, unhappy family right now. The majority of the students are as traumatized by data structures and algorithms as I was when I first went through this part of the curriculum. I&#8217;ve actually been helping some of them through Zoom and Slack, both with coding and with general sanity. Its nice to see that I&#8217;ve learned a little, but its also troubling to see other people in the same state of depression and panic that I was when I first endured this unit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. I was chatting on Zoom with some other students and learned that one of them had taken the GCA without showing his photo ID. He said that we don&#8217;t need it to take the test. We only need it to verify the score if we want to show it to employers. For Lambda&#8217;s purposes, its unnecessary. This hadn&#8217;t been made clear to us when we got the initial surprise. Two weeks ago, when I learned this, I took the GCA. I passed it. It wasn&#8217;t a high score &#8211; we need 650 points to pass and I just scraped by with 652, but it was still a success.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t discuss specific problems on the test, but its made up of 4 coding challenges. I think they&#8217;re randomly picked from a pool. We have 70 mins to solve them. When we&#8217;ve done these types of challenges in class, some of them take us less than a half hour to finish. Others take hours. I didn&#8217;t think I had a snowball&#8217;s chance in hell of passing, but from what others have said, we basically need to complete one question and some of another to pass. I managed that. I completed the first challenge and had a partially-complete second problem. It was enough to make the bottom of the barrel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next time I can reattempt the test is actually this Friday &#8211; New Year&#8217;s Day. So, I&#8217;m going to try it again and see if I can improve my score. My understanding is that Lambda keeps the highest score. Since I manage to pass, I don&#8217;t have the pressure of aiming for that anymore, so I can try to do better with no risk. But that leads me to another reaction&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not happy that we were told that the test would be proctored and that we needed to have our photo ID to take it. I could have tried taking it back in October and again every two weeks after that. I might have passed and been in Labs now. I also might have a higher score now. I wasted a lot of time over potentially nothing. And to top it off, the day after I took the test, my replacement license arrived in the mail, here in CA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Project &#8211; Mahiya</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have two weeks off from Lambda for winter break. Its the middle of the second week right now. On Monday next week (Jan 4th), classes start again. Prior to the break, <strong>Mahiya Hoque</strong>, a designer that I&#8217;d been in contact with, posted in Lambda&#8217;s Slack asking for help with her portfolio. She had built it using <strong>Elementor</strong> in WordPress and was having trouble setting up a sidebar. I offered to help, because I&#8217;ve used WordPress for my own blogs (like this one) and used <strong>Divi</strong> for <strong>Breast Cancer Comfort</strong>&#8216;s website, at the behest of their marketing person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor frustrated me as much as Divi does, so I offered to just rebuild her site with React. She agreed. Over the course of a few weeks, between classes and whenever I could find time, I worked on it and got most of it done. I based it on the WordPress site. As I went, she put together a Figma file for the site and revised it. I ended up referencing that file and updated my work. It was my first time working with a designer. Her style is completely different from mine. Its interesting to build with someone else&#8217;s specifications. I have the main desktop site done and have to implement the mobile and tablet versions still and then tweak some things, but I&#8217;m happy with how its come along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a few points in which I got stuck, but I eventually figured things out. My JavaScript is rusty, because we&#8217;ve been using Python for a while now at Lambda and haven&#8217;t touched any JavaScript in months, so I had to relearn React Router and some other things. My hope is to have it complete in a few weeks and add it to my portfolio, as well as giving her an actual portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"919\" height=\"622\" data-attachment-id=\"1951\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/mahiya-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"919,622\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mahiya-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=919\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=919\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1951\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg 919w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mahiya-1.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 919px) 100vw, 919px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Project &#8211; Iconic Web Studios</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this week, I started experimenting with <strong>Next.js</strong>, a React framework. Its interesting to me to see that libraries now have frameworks. But that aside, I really like Next.js so far. I went through some of their tutorial a few days before Christmas. Then I got the idea to build something with it, just to see if I was getting the hang of it. So, I started a project I&#8217;ve been thinking about for a few weeks: a small web development company. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were still living in New York, I had wanted to do it. I was just waiting to get through more of Lambda first. I was going to call it <strong>Simple Design Solutions</strong>, but I back-burnered the idea for the rest of the year. Last week, I found a woman somewhere in the Midwest who already uses that name for her own work. I can&#8217;t remember but I think she knits or sews. Even though we&#8217;re in different states and different industries, I didn&#8217;t want to step on her toes, so I had to come up with a new name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I listed words that I liked that were associated with building something unique, and finally (with the help of my 8-year-old) had to pick between <strong>Iconic Web Solutions</strong> and <strong>Iconic Web Studios</strong>. She liked Studios, so here we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway. My plan is to build websites for small businesses and individuals. I won&#8217;t charge an up-front cost for the sites. Instead, I&#8217;ll charge a monthly fee to host, maintain and update the site. This should be less risky for small businesses to take a chance on, and it&#8217;ll allow me to improve my basic web building skills while providing a useful product and service to others. Hopefully, it&#8217;ll take off and be a win-win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to launch it in January. I have some of the site drafted and online at Netlify. I need to figure out how to get clients though. Selling and advertising was never my strong-point.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"466\" data-attachment-id=\"1955\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/iconic-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1349,614\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"iconic-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1955\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/iconic-1.jpg 1349w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\">Personal / Other</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been reading a lot about landing programming jobs and about saving for retirement, securing my kids&#8217; futures, helping the community around me and the world-at-large. This year, I discovered the concept of the <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_nomad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">digital nomad</a></strong>. Its a lifestyle that really appeals to me. Basically, its programmers (and other people who can work remotely) who travel and work from different places abroad. They see the world, eat the food, meet the people and work from their laptops. Their offices end up being beaches, mountains, hotels and really just interesting places. I want to do that. I want to code in the forest. I want to build websites from mountaintops and outside of the Pyramids and in so many other places. I want to take my kids with me so they can see the wonders of the world. If Iconic takes off, maybe in a few years, that will be my new reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" data-attachment-id=\"1956\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,480\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg?w=640\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg?w=640\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1956\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/mike-swigunski-e9u4zs9xuyw-unsplash.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its the end of the year and the start of a new decade. 2020 has been eventful.
