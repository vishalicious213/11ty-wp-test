As related from previous posts, there&#8217;s a lot going on, with the move to California, my hiatus from Lambda being over, Coronavirus rearing its head (we&#8217;re right by the NY epicenter in New Rochelle, which is like a 5-min drive from here) and generally managing the kids. I need to get back to posting about Lambda School. For some reason, I have a block with writing the Components II post that I need to finish before I can move onto React, where I&#8217;ve been focusing most of my time recently. I&#8217;m going to get that done before March is over.</p>\n<h2>Anniversary</h2>\n<p>Anyway, March 18th was our anniversary. My wife and I have been together for 20 years now, with 10 of them being married. We&#8217;re old news. I shared it in the Mental Health channel on Lambda&#8217;s Slack, because we&#8217;re usually writing more about doom and gloom there, and I wanted to help populate it with a spot of light here and there.</p>\n<p>Due to Coronavirus, we didn&#8217;t go out to celebrate. We basically remained home, sequestered with the kids, and worked on cleaning the house, prepping for CA and I worked on React projects. On the plus side, this really raises the chances that our 30th anniversary will be more exciting.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/03\\/25\\/march-2020-update\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

At the end of the month, they&#8217;ll reassess to see if it will be closed further. I expect that it will, because the virus isn&#8217;t going to just recede, especially in a populous area like where we live. The older one&#8217;s classes are now online, so she&#8217;s happy. She enjoys using the computer and this gives her an excuse from school to basically emulate me and sit for hours staring at a screen.</p>\n<p>Its been rough though. Working on Lambda is hard to balance with regular work and managing the kids. They interrupt a lot. A lot. Its frustrating to be deep into trying to understand a project or a new concept and then have my focus shattered because the kids are fighting with each other or the older one has quietly switched to YouTube and is now shouting about a Roblox or Minecraft video. I&#8217;m not so young anymore, so when I lose my concentration, I have to restart, and its time-consuming. Some of it has gotten better, just in the last week. I&#8217;m finally beginning to really understand the basics of React, so there are things I can pick right back up with, even after being pulled away for World War III: Junior Edition and having to impost martial law on the kiddos and separate them until tempers recede and new peace treaties can be broken.</p>\n<h2>Lambda Kids</h2>\n<p>The older one is super-excited. Since I started Lambda, she&#8217;s wanted to do the same. She&#8217;s always talked about having a &#8220;Lambda Kids&#8221; school and now, Lambda is actually making that a short-term reality. Last week, they announced that classes are suspended for two weeks (which began this Monday) on account of Coronavirus. They&#8217;re offering services for students who are still interested, and cohorts that had a build week (like mine, in WEBPT14) can join an optional build week that starts next week. They recommended that we take the time to rest and tend to our mental health, but I&#8217;m using it to catch up with the curriculum and work on projects.</p>\n<p>Anyway, one amazing thing that they did was start coding classes for kids. They were originally slated to happen twice a week, on Mondays and Wednesdays, but due to the sheer response they got, they&#8217;re running them Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays for the next two weeks. Its volunteer-driven, with our instructors leading the classes and conducting them via Zoom. Parents who signed up have to remain close by to the kids, to supervise, and I think the classes are an hour long and will focus on Scratch.</p>\n<p>The idea is that parents who are now home with the kids and who are having a hard time managing them, will have an educational activity that they can work on with them, and which helps teach them about coding. I might have been one of the people who mentioned the difficulties balancing the kiddos being at home with activities at Lambda in one or two of the Slack channels&#8230;</p>\n<p>There are two groups of classes. One is for 6-9-year olds and the other is for 10-12-year olds. My daughter is really excited for it. <strong>Brit Hemming</strong>, who was my instructor when I started Lambda (I did HTML, CSS and the initial JS stuff with her) is one of the instructors. She&#8217;s taught children before and started a channel in Slack about it as well. It&#8217;ll be fun if she ends up being both my former instructor and now, my daughter&#8217;s.</p>\n<p>There were a deluge of applicants, so I think that the classes will be broken into two week-long sessions. We&#8217;re in the 2nd week&#8217;s run.</p>\n<h2>Lambda and Coding</h2>\n<p>Finally, classes started back up for me on March 9th, which was also my mother&#8217;s birthday. She&#8217;s catching up to dad. He&#8217;s 81 and she&#8217;s now 78. Back in January, Student Success said that when I started back, WEBPT14 would be starting React. They miscalculated a bit. This cohort already finished unit 1 of React (Intro to React) and were beginning unit 2 (Single-Page Applications) when I started; so I&#8217;m essentially two weeks behind.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t do well with this when I ran it the first time, because there was a lot going on at home (the two weddings, tons of family over, the kids starting school, wife&#8217;s work and my own, people getting sick &#8211; all of the usual craziness with life). My hope was that I&#8217;d go through it all again and come out of the other side with a solid understanding. The path to that has changed somewhat, but I&#8217;m still intent on getting there.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1568\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/march-2020-update/avengers/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"506,295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"avengers\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg?w=506\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1568\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg?w=506&#038;h=295\" alt=\"avengers\" width=\"506\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg 506w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/avengers.jpg?w=300&amp;h=175 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></p>\n<p>Although I&#8217;m behind, I&#8217;m working on catching up. I didn&#8217;t get to do any of the formal assignments for this unit yet. I&#8217;ve been working on the Intro to React stuff. I did make an Avengers app with <a href=\"https://reacttraining.com/react-router/\"><strong>React Router</strong></a>, from unit 2, last week. I also completed the sprint challenge, but not in the allotted time. The first time I tried it, before I flexed to this unit, I got through it all except for creating a working search bar. This time, the same thing happened, but I kept working at it and managed to create the search bar. The only issue is that it wasn&#8217;t within the allotted 3-hour timeframe. I have something that works to reference now though, so if I have to retake the sprint challenge, I&#8217;ll be able to complete it.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been chatting with another student from the Bronx named Allan, who was in WEBPT10 with me and is also now in WEBPT14. He shared a video from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q\"><strong>Dev Ed</strong></a> with me, which was about React Router. It was a good video. Dev Ed has come up in my YouTube feed a bunch of times but I never watched his videos. I&#8217;m a subscriber now. I worked through a video tutorial of his that has us create an application that connects to the <a href=\"https://www.edamam.com/\"><strong>Edamam API</strong></a> and download recipe information. It included a search bar. Going through that tutorial helped a lot with my finally completing that part of MVP for the sprint challenge, even though I didn&#8217;t do it on time.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1569\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/march-2020-update/rick-and-morty/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"506,295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rick-and-morty\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=506\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1569\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=506&#038;h=295\" alt=\"rick-and-morty\" width=\"506\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg 506w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/rick-and-morty.jpg?w=300&amp;h=175 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></p>\n<p>I added all three of those recent projects (the sprint challenge, which connects to the <a href=\"https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation\"><strong>Rick and Morty API</strong></a>, the Avengers one which uses React Router but local data, and the recipe one from Dev Ed) to my portfolio.</p>\n<p>For the recipe one, I also combined some info from <strong>Brad Traversy</strong>&#8216;s React course with what Dev Ed was doing &#8211; I used environment variables in a .local.env file to store my login info to the Edamam API instead of having them in open sight in one of the files that are viewable at GitHub. It all worked locally, but when I published to <a href=\"https://www.netlify.com/\"><strong>Netlify</strong></a>, the API call was failing. I figured out how to make Netlify use the environment variables though, so that info is still protected, but the application can access it to make API calls. I&#8217;ll post about it separately, later.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1570\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/25/march-2020-update/10-recipes/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"506,295\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"10-recipes\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=506\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1570\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=506&#038;h=295\" alt=\"10-recipes\" width=\"506\" height=\"295\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg 506w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=150&amp;h=87 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/10-recipes.jpg?w=300&amp;h=175 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px\" /></p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to get that Components II post written in the next few days and also work on React, and finally start writing about it too. I have a ton of things I wanted to share on the blog, but haven&#8217;t, because I also want to try and keep most of the material here my own, but I&#8217;ve been reading articles and watching videos and have a giant file on Evernote with links I&#8217;m going to figure out a way to share, hopefully without them dominating the blog.

GitHub","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/03/11/how-to-make-a-new-repo-of-a-project-that-you-already-forked-on-github/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-oK","content":"<p>So, two days ago, my 6-week hiatus ended and I resumed learning at Lambda School. I&#8217;m in WEBPT14 now. The Student Success person who helped me to go on hiatus thought that this cohort was going to be starting React, but she was a little off. They&#8217;re actually in the second unit of React (Single Page Applications). I thought I&#8217;d be able to do the entirety of React all over again with them, but I&#8217;m essentially starting 4 lessons and a sprint challenge past where I wanted to be.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m going to try to redo the stuff I worked on last time, and finally do the projects that I didn&#8217;t get to do (on account of real-life getting in the way) the first time around. I can&#8217;t just fork the projects that were already completed again, because GitHub tells me that the given project has already been forked.</p>\n<p>I ran into this same issue when I switched from WEB23 to WEBPT10 last year and a student from WEBPT8 named <strong>Nick Durbin</strong> helped me with it.

month since I last posted. A lot of stuff has happened in that time. I went on a 6-week hiatus from <strong>Lambda School</strong>, so I could work on some projects and also bone up on JavaScript and React. I&#8217;ve been working through <strong>Brad Traversy</strong>&#8216;s JS and React courses from <strong>Udemy.</strong> I posted some of the JS stuff as I was going through it already &#8211; mostly to compare it with the curriculum at Lambda. So far, I&#8217;ve found it to be an excellent compliment to Lambda&#8217;s material. On its own, its less comprehensive with regard to theory and explanation, but as a source of projects and an additional perspective on JavaScript, its been very helpful to me.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/\">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning: Section 2 – JavaScript Language Fundamentals (1 of 3)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/\">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning: Section 2 – JavaScript Language Fundamentals (2 of 3)</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/\">Modern JavaScript From The Beginning: Section 2 – JavaScript Language Fundamentals (3 of 3)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I switched part-through and started working on the React course, because I&#8217;m a bit more excited by React (although I completely understand and agree with the advice I read everywhere about getting a solid foundation in vanilla JavaScript). Its also been very helpful &#8211; moreso, to me, that the JavaScript one has been so far. At Lambda, we started learning React using Hooks, which can now use state. Then, we learned about Class Components. With Traversy&#8217;s course, we started with Class Components and then refactored our code to use Hooks. Doing that really helped me to see the differences between the two. I need to drill it a lot more, so that I know it cold, but the approach and the direct contrast by refactoring a project was illuminating. There were some other very useful tidbits, like adding some VS Code extensions that Traversy uses, which I&#8217;ve found helpful, but I&#8217;ll get into that later, when I eventually blog about the course.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/\"><strong>Udemy: React Front to Back</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>California</h2>\n<p>In early December last year, my wife applied for a library director position at <strong><a href=\"https://calarts.edu/\">CalArts</a>,</strong> in <strong><a href=\"https://www.santa-clarita.com/\">Santa Clarita</a></strong>. They flew her out for a 2-day interview with the administration and staff, including a presentation and some other things. After the holiday break, they followed up with phone interviews, I think it might have been from the provost and then the president of the university. To make a long story short &#8211; she applied on a lark, thinking that even if she doesn&#8217;t get the job, its good practice, and she ended up landing the position. We accepted in February. She let the administration and her staff at <strong><a href=\"http://www.lehman.edu/\">Lehman College</a></strong>, in the Bronx know, earlier this month, and she&#8217;s slated to start in the beginning of July.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1522\" style=\"width: 526px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1522\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1522\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/02/26/quick-update-were-moving-to-california/ca-laina/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"516,263\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ca-laina\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg?w=516\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1522\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg?w=516&#038;h=263\" alt=\"ca-laina\" width=\"516\" height=\"263\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg 516w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg?w=150&amp;h=76 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-laina.jpg?w=300&amp;h=153 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 516px) 100vw, 516px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1522\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Our friend Laina&#8217;s book is in circulation!</p></div>\n<p>Its a big move for us &#8211; we&#8217;ve visited California a few times to see my sister when she lived in different parts of the state. Now, we&#8217;re looking at moving there, with 2 kids. Last week, she and I took a flight out there, during our older daughter&#8217;s winter break, and met with agents who the school hired to help us with the relocation. We stayed at my sister&#8217;s place, about an hour and a half away, and toured Santa Clarita with the agent and a realtor. We looked at houses, apartments, gated communities, schools and (of course) the food in the area. Most of the schools are &#8220;blue ribbon,&#8221; which means that they&#8217;re performing above the state average. The ones we were most interested in, naturally, were the ones rated highly by the state &#8211; so on a scale of 1-10, anything 8+. There are quite a few of them in the area.</p>\n<p>The system is different from here in Yonkers, NY. Here, if you live in a city and move to another, you&#8217;re pushed to the new city&#8217;s school district. Schools can get filled up quickly, so your kids don&#8217;t necessarily end up in a nearby school &#8211; the one our daughter goes to, for example, is about a 15-minute drive from us, but she had to actually test in to attend it. In Santa Clarita, the city in which you reside (they&#8217;re actually more like small towns to me) determines what school you go to, but if you move to another city in Santa Clarita, your kids can elect to remain at their school &#8211; and other kids in the family are grandfathered in. I like it. It gives us the flexibility to rent somewhere for some time (we&#8217;re thinking a year or two) with a well-rated school, and then look for somewhere affordable to live. We don&#8217;t need to worry about changing schools midway through and disrupting our daughters&#8217; lives with settling into a whole new school environment.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/02\\/26\\/quick-update-were-moving-to-california\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

The architect who planned the city there built them as small, interlinked communities. Each school is built alongside a large park/playground. The towns are connected to each other by <em>paseos,</em> which are trails and small bridges that link them together. Its possible for families to walk these and never have to deal with motor traffic. They&#8217;re patrolled by police, as well. Its a lot more outdoorsy than I&#8217;ve been for years. Its also a lot more sleepy than I&#8217;m used to, living 15 mins from NYC. There&#8217;s no night-life (people online all basically say, for night-life, drive to LA). Stores close early (to me). I don&#8217;t know if they have 24-hour diners. There&#8217;s only one hospital for the entire region &#8211; in Yonkers, alone, we have 3 hospitals, and we&#8217;re a stone&#8217;s throw from a number of others all over Westchester and the Bronx and Manhattan.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1526\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/02/26/quick-update-were-moving-to-california/ca-art-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"960,540\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ca-art-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=960\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1526\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=960&#038;h=540\" alt=\"ca-art-4\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg 960w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/ca-art-4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /></p>\n<h3>Food</h3>\n<p>Food also looks a bit different there. Its diverse, but with a different set of ethnicities than here. We both have Chinese, Japanese and Korean food, but their&#8217;s seems to be a bit fresher (I haven&#8217;t seen greasy Chinese food, like we get here, over there). Their Thai was better than ours. They have a lot of Filipino food, we have to go to Queens or NJ for a lot of that, with only 1-2 spots in Westchester, Rockland and Manhattan available otherwise. I haven&#8217;t seen anything like Malaysian or Indonesian there. I did see a few Vietnamese spots, but we have more. There was some Indian food, but we have a ton more, both in the NYC area and outside of it. They also have no West Indian food at all. So far, in the US, I&#8217;ve really only seen West Indian food (Trinidad, Guyana and Surinam) in NY and Florida &#8211; there&#8217;s sometimes Jamaican food elsewhere, but its focus isn&#8217;t really the same, even though its geographically similar.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/02\\/26\\/quick-update-were-moving-to-california\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

Their Mexican food is also different from ours. One of my friends who lives in CA, and who we visited 2 years ago when we saw my sister, said that CA Mexican food is really its own thing &#8211; its distinct from traditional Mexican food, Tex-Mex and other regional variations. I think there were some Peruvian spots there, but I&#8217;m used to seeing a bit more Peruvian and Ecuadorian places by us as well. I don&#8217;t remember seeing any African or Middle-Eastern fare at all, and we have those both in the City&#8217;s vicinity as well as outside of it.

Divi is useful for people with no coding experience, although it has a learning curve, itself. Its just much faster for me to actually write CSS than it is to tinker with Divi settings to try and match what I can do by hand in 1-2 lines of code. A lot of this has to do with positioning and resizing, and with layout. Flexbox and CSS Grid let me do a lot. Nesting containers in Divi is much more of a chore, and the biggest timesink is that I can&#8217;t use the interface to natively select elements by class or type. Every style change I make is essentially independent, and I have to duplicate it by hand. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a way to use custom CSS to remedy this (or at least I strongly think that there should be) but I haven&#8217;t learned it yet.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/\">Breast Cancer Comfort (WP/Divi)</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1509\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/02/26/quick-update-were-moving-to-california/bcc-divi1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1212,880\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-divi1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1509\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=1212&#038;h=880\" alt=\"bcc-divi1\" width=\"1212\" height=\"880\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg 1212w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=218 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=558 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bcc-divi1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=743 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1212px) 100vw, 1212px\" /></p>\n<h2>The Kiddo&#8217;s Blog</h2>\n<p>Finally, my older daughter (she&#8217;s 7 now) started a coding blog, about 2 weeks ago. I walked her through setting up a site on WordPress, and she did it. I helped her edit it, initially, with choosing a theme that she liked and then removing some default elements and posts, but by the end, she had gone to Google and found images she wanted to use, learned a little bit of how to edit them with the old copy of Photoshop that I&#8217;m still running on my desktop, learned some of how to upload images and navigate the file system in Windows (she knows a little of that already from other stuff she&#8217;s done) and over the weekend, when I got back from Cali, she wrote her first post as well. We made the site live 3 days ago, so she&#8217;s excited. She started a coding group at her school that she calls The Coding Scouts and tries to teach her friends about Scratch (and I think, Python) on Wednesdays. So, this is my first shout-out to it, and to her efforts, on this blog. I&#8217;ll share it on FB when she has some more content.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1508\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/02/26/quick-update-were-moving-to-california/bopps-blog/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1043,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Bopps &#8211; blog\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1508\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=1043&#038;h=800\" alt=\"Bopps - blog\" width=\"1043\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg 1043w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=150&amp;h=115 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=300&amp;h=230 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=768&amp;h=589 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bopps-blog.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=785 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1043px) 100vw, 1043px\" /></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://coolcoders.code.blog/\">The Coding Kid</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Oh, and wifey&#8217;s birthday was on Monday!

blog turned 1 today. Happy birthday!","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/26/the-blog-turned-1-today-happy-birthday/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-nH","content":"<p>So, I started this blog a year ago, today. I began by trying to self-teach Python, but after a short while, I fizzled out. I kept watching videos and reading articles about programming though, and eventually discovered <strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/06/lambda-school/\">Lambda School</a></strong> from one of <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97vVdQocLR0&amp;t=1s\">Joshua Fluke</a></strong>&#8216;s videos on YouTube. I ended up applying to Lambda, completing the pre-course material and passing the challenge to join their full-stack web development track. After several weeks moving full-steam ahead in a full-time cohort, I found that I couldn&#8217;t keep up, so I flexed into a part-time cohort. I&#8217;m currently in the midst of a 6-week hiatus so I can independently improve my JavaScript and React skills, and then return to Lambda in March (on my mother&#8217;s birthday, no less).</p>\n<p>For the first half of 2019, I don&#8217;t think I made much serious headway towards learning how to code, but I did learn a lot about the art of coding and about the industry itself, from reading and watching other people online. There are many resources available on YouTube, Reddit, other blogs, podcasts and websites in general. Sifting through it all and not drowning in information overload can be a challenge at times &#8211; ultimately, much of that needs to be controlled after a while or it becomes a distraction from actually sitting down with a code editor and writing code, or white-boarding or thinking through steps needed to actually build a working application or website.</p>\n<p>Since applying to and joining Lambda, I do see that I&#8217;ve learned a few things. So, the 2nd half of the year went a lot better. I understand fundamental web technologies like HTML, CSS, LESS and JavaScript now and can comfortably use the first three of those skills to create responsive websites. Getting better with JavaScript is currently my main focus, coupled with React, which is the most-widely-used front-end library for JavaScript in the world. Before my hiatus is over, I&#8217;m going to have worked through <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb\">Brad Traversy</a></strong>&#8216;s <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/\"><strong>JavaScript</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/\">React</a></strong> courses on Udemy, among other things. Also &#8211; I completed my first <a href=\"https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/\"><strong>Hacktoberfest</strong></a> last year and don&#8217;t think I blogged about it yet!</p>\n<p>With the small understanding that I have, I&#8217;ve been able to build simple, responsive websites, including a project for a non-profit and a redesign of the corporate website (.com) and application website (.org) at work which I&#8217;m polishing a little before launch. I wish I was moving at a faster pace (don&#8217;t we all) but I&#8217;m content with what I&#8217;ve learned in the past 6 months. I&#8217;m looking forward to writing an update to this in 2021. We do have another big announcement yet to make, but I&#8217;m waiting for the go-ahead from someone else before I do so.</p>\n<p>Happy coding, to all of you. I hope we all succeed. I hope we improve the world.</p>\n<p>Oh &#8211; and I&#8217;m going to make a FB Page linked to this blog, now that its getting baby teeth.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2020\\/01\\/26\\/the-blog-turned-1-today-happy-birthday\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 328px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"328\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 247px; height: 328px;\" data-original-width=\"247\" data-original-height=\"328\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/26/the-blog-turned-1-today-happy-birthday/withkiddos-before/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"243\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"324\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1478\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-before.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"720,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"withkiddos-before\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-before.jpg?w=225\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-before.jpg?w=720\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-before.jpg?w=243&#038;h=324&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"243\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"243\" data-original-height=\"324\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"withkiddos-before\" alt=\"withkiddos-before\" style=\"width: 243px; height: 324px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 253px; height: 328px;\" data-original-width=\"253\" data-original-height=\"328\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/26/the-blog-turned-1-today-happy-birthday/withkiddos-after/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"249\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"324\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1477\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-after.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"739,960\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"withkiddos-after\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-after.jpg?w=231\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-after.jpg?w=739\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/withkiddos-after.jpg?w=249&#038;h=324&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"249\" height=\"324\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"249\" data-original-height=\"324\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"withkiddos-after\" alt=\"withkiddos-after\" style=\"width: 249px; height: 324px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, I started this blog a year ago, today.

last of 3 posts dealing with <strong>JavaScript Fundamentals</strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb\">Brad Traversy</a></strong>‘s <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/\">Modern JavaScript From the Beginning</a></strong> course on <strong>Udemy</strong>. It compares the course with <strong><a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda</a></strong> material, from the pre-course and the full-stack developer track. (<em>See part 1 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/\"><strong>here</strong></a> and part 2 <strong><a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/\">here</a></strong>.</em>)</p>\n<h4>If Statements &amp; Comparison Operators</h4>\n<p>This lesson looks at if statements, if/else statements and comparison operators. It explains that if statements are use to evaluate a condition and then do something based on that condition, or do something else if the condition isn&#8217;t met.</p>\n<p>I think that everyone who&#8217;s ever looked at a program is familiar with the concept of an if statement, and many have seen other versions of it, like in a flowchart or when learning about logic.</p>\n<p>Immediately after introducing the concept of an if statement, the lesson moves into the equal comparison operator (==) and its difference with the assignment operator (=). It then uses both of these to give an example of an if statement by setting a const equal to a number (=) and then writing an if statement that opens by checking if a variable has the same value as that number (==) and console.logs text if it is true. The code is then expanded with an else conditional that console.logs different text if the value is not a match.</p>\n<p>Once that&#8217;s done, the if statement is reversed by adding a &#8220;not&#8221; to the equal sign in the form of an exclamation point &#8211; so not equal looks like &#8220;!=&#8221;. I remember my first TL, Reed, showing this to us during JavaScript Fundamentals at Lambda. He said that the convention is to call it a &#8220;bang&#8221;. So not equal is spelled with a bang and an equal sign. After our group stand-up sessions, he&#8217;d often host JavaScript challenges, in which he&#8217;d grab problems from <a href=\"https://edabit.com/\"><strong>Edabit</strong></a> or another site and we&#8217;d work on them as a group. I remember him using the bang on several other occasions to reverse entire blocks of logic in certain conditional statements.</p>\n<p>With the comparison and assignment operators under our belts, the lesson introduces the third little pig in the form of &#8220;===&#8221;. So, two equal signs compares the values of two things to see if they&#8217;re the same. In the example, the number 100 and the string &#8220;100&#8221; are equivalent, so they&#8217;re a match. However there are times in which the value AND the type need to be the same. This is supposed to help reduce errors and the possibility of bugs, down the road. For this, we need the three equal signs, which compares both value and type. In this case, 100 and &#8220;100&#8221; are not the same.</p>\n<p>Naturally, there are &#8220;not&#8221; versions of these as well, in she shape of &#8220;!=&#8221; and &#8220;!==&#8221;.</p>\n<p>The assignment operator (=) and the comparison operator (==) have both been thorns in my side in the past. There have been at least 3 separate occasions in which I&#8217;ve written if statements, accidentally used an &#8220;=&#8221; in the comparison, and not triggered else statements in my code. On two of these occasions, TLs who reviewed my code (first Reed, and then Angel, my 2nd TL, a while later on a different project) discovered my error, and I vowed not to repeat it again, until it craftily happened one more time.</p>\n<p>Lambda went over comparison operators during the pre-course. I remember seeing &#8220;&gt;&#8221;, &#8220;&lt;&#8220;, &#8220;&gt;=&#8221;, &#8220;&lt;=&#8221;, &#8220;===&#8221;, &#8220;!==&#8221; and &#8220;!&#8221;. They cautioned against using the double equal sign, citing its use as a bad practice because it doesn&#8217;t compare type, only value. The convention at Lambda is to use the triple equal sign. They also continued from there to go over logical operators, including &#8220;&amp;&amp;&#8221; (and) and &#8220;||&#8221; (or).</p>\n<p>Ok. Next, the lesson showed something I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve seen before &#8211; it tested the value of a variable, returning its value if it was set, and returning a different message if it wasn&#8217;t. When tested with &#8220;if(variable)&#8221; the result was that the value was console.logged. However, when tested after commenting out the variable, the result wasn&#8217;t the other message &#8211; it was an error that the variable was undefined.</p>\n<p>The correct way to test, and avoid the undefined error, is to use logic like:</p>\n<pre>if(typeof variable !== 'undefined') {\n  [do something]\n} else {\n  [do something else];\n}</pre>\n<p>So, this apparently checks first, to make sure that the variable exists, before it runs code that executes based on the value of the variable.</p>\n<p>Further tests checked against greater than (&gt;), less than (&lt;), greater than or equal to (&gt;=) and less than or equal to (&lt;=). The lesson then moved on to if/else.</p>\n<p>If/else differs from if in a significant way &#8211; its not just that a response can be provided if an initial condition isn&#8217;t met &#8211; its that it can test for <em>additional</em> conditions.</p>\n<pre>const bassist = \"Alex Webster\";\n\nif(bassist === 'Alex Webster'){\n  console.log('Spector Alex Webster Signature Edition');\n} else if(bassist === 'Steve DiGiorgio'){\n  console.log('Fretless Ibanez BTB1605E');\n} else if(bassist === 'Jeroen Thesseling'){\n  console.log('Fretless Warwick Thumb NT 7-string');\n} else {\n  console.log('Bassist and equipment are unknown.');\n}</pre>\n<p>With if/else under our belts, the lesson moved on to logical operators, starting with using the &amp;&amp; (and) operator to include two different conditions before executing a result. For example:</p>\n<pre>if(temperature &gt; 65 &amp;&amp; temperature &lt; 80){\n  console.log('Its a comfortable day, outside.');\n} else if(temperature &gt;=50 &amp;&amp; temperature &lt;=64){\n  console.log('Its chilly, outside.');\n} else {\n  console.log('The temperature is crazy for this time of year!');\n}</pre>\n<p>Next came the || (or) operator. The difference between this and &amp;&amp; is that &amp;&amp; checks to see if each condition its testing is true before executing a code block. || will execute if any included condition is true &#8211; exactly like truth tables, back in junior high school math.</p>\n<p>The ternary operator followed &#8211; its essentially a single-line method of writing an if/else statement. During JavaScript Fundamentals, Reed showed this to our group, and one other person who had been to another coding bootcamp also knew it, but it was new to the rest of us. Lambda officially showed it to us later on in the curriculum, during the first lesson of Intro to React, when we started exploring conditional rendering.</p>\n<p>One important tidbit, for me, is that when using React, we can&#8217;t use if statements in JSX, which is the HTML-equivalent embedded into React that&#8217;s used to render output to the screen. It threw me for a loop for the longest time when working on v3 of my portfolio. However, we can use ternary operators in place of if/else, and if we have more than one condition to test against, we can use switch statements, which are covered in the next lesson in Modern JS, but were covered much later at Lambda.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator\">MDN: Conditional (ternary) operator</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;re shown that in JavaScript, we actually don&#8217;t need to surround blocks of code in curly braces in an if statement. I never knew this! Its recommended that we use them anyway, but the video gives us an example of an if/else statement without curly braces, and it executes properly.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/23/lambda-school-pre-course-9-learn-to-use-basic-control-flow-and-if-else-statements/\"><strong>Pre-course 9: Learn to use Basic Control Flow and If/Else Statements</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/24/lambda-school-pre-course-10-learn-to-write-control-flow-using-if-else-statements/\">Pre-course 10: Learn to write control flow using if/else statements</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1429\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1429\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1429\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-12 if-else and conditionals\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1429\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-12 if-else and conditionals\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-12-if-else-and-conditionals.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1429\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Conditional operators</p></div>\n<h4>Switches</h4>\n<p>Switch statements are another type of conditional, and can be used in lieu of if/else statements. This is what our if/else statement from above would look like as a switch statement:</p>\n<pre>const bassist = \"Alex Webster\";\n\nswitch(bassist){\n  case 'Alex Webster': \n    console.log('Spector Alex Webster Signature Edition');\n    break;\n  case 'Steve DiGiorgio':\n    console.log('Fretless Ibanez BTB1605E');\n    break;\n  case 'Jeroen Thesseling':\n    console.log('Fretless Warwick Thumb NT 7-string');\n    break;\n  default:\n    console.log('Bassist and equipment are unknown.');\n    break;\n}</pre>\n<p>Modern JS recommends using switches instead of if/else statements if there are many conditions to check. I used them in v3 of my portfolio in React/JSX because if statements can&#8217;t be used in JSX (it has something to do with evaluating down to HTML, but I can&#8217;t remember the specifics. I&#8217;ll post about it when I finish refactoring my portfolio).</p>\n<p>Lambda went over these sometime during React, but I was already behind and looking to flex to another unit, so I didn&#8217;t get to write about any of that yet, and don&#8217;t remember exactly when it was introduced. It must have been in Advanced React, Advanced State Management or Advanced Web Applications though.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1432\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1432\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1432\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/2-13-switches/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-13 switches\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1432\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-13 switches\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-13-switches.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1432\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Switch statements</p></div>\n<h4>Function Declarations &amp; Expressions</h4>\n<p>Functions are blocks of code that can be created and called at a later time, or sometimes, executed immediately. They&#8217;re like little programs inside of a program that generally do one specific thing. This lesson goes over several kinds:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">Function declarations</span></li>\n<li>Function expressions</li>\n<li>Immediately invocable function expression (pronounced iffy)</li>\n<li>Property methods</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Function declarations</strong> define a function so it can be called for use later. Generally, these functions return something that can be used outside of the function, via the &#8220;return&#8221; statement.</p>\n<pre>function jaco(){\n  return 'Jaco only needed four strings!';\n}\n\nconsole.log(jaco()); //calls the function and console.logs its output</pre>\n<p>Functions can take variables (arguments) when they&#8217;re called and use them. If they specify arguments, like if the above example started with &#8220;function jaco(name)&#8221; then it would expect a name to be passed in. If one weren&#8217;t, it would output &#8220;undefined&#8221; where that argument would have been used, like if the body returned:</p>\n<pre>return \"Jaco only needed four strings, \" + name + \"!\";</pre>\n<p>One new thing I learned from watching this lesson is how to set default values for functions, so that if no arguments are passed into a function, it still outputs something other than &#8220;undefined&#8221; where data was missing. The old way looked something like this:</p>\n<pre>function jaco(name){\n  if(typeof name === \"undefined\"){name = 'Wooten'};\n  return \"Jaco only needed four strings, \" + name + \"!\";\n}\n\nconsole.log(jaco());</pre>\n<p>If data is passed in, like &#8220;console.log(jaco(&#8216;Jackson&#8217;));&#8221; then that data overwrites &#8220;Wooten&#8221; and is used instead.</p>\n<p>With ES6, we now have a cleaner way to set default values for a function. We simply include the values directly in the function declaration, like this (and we can rewrite the return using string literals, too!):</p>\n<pre>function jaco(name = 'Wooten'){\n  return `<code>Jaco only needed four strings, ${name}!</code>`;\n}</pre>\n<p>A <strong>function expression</strong> assigns a function to a variable. They can be named or anonymous, but are usually anonymous. In both cases (declaring  a function or using a function expression) if more than one default value needs to be set, they can be separated using commas (firstName = &#8216;Anthony&#8217;, lastName = &#8216;Jackson&#8217;).</p>\n<pre>const jaco = function(name = 'Wooten'){\n  return `Jaco only needed four strings, ${name}!`;\n};\n\nconsole.log(jaco('Jackson'));</pre>\n<p>Using function expressions and declaring functions don&#8217;t make a huge difference initially. Later on, when dealing with more advanced topics like hoisting and clojures, then favoring one over the other can make a difference.</p>\n<p>An <strong>Immediately Invocable Function Expression</strong> (IIFE) is a function that&#8217;s declared and run at the same time. To do this, we turn it into an expression by placing it inside of parenthesis. We also have to remember to end it with a trailing set of parenthesis, which is a format requirement for all functions, like this:</p>\n<pre>(function(name='Wooten'){\n  console.log(`Jaco only needed four strings, ${name}!`);\n})('Jackson');</pre>\n<p>Note the default argument value of &#8220;Wooten&#8221;, that the entire function is inside of a pair of parenthesis, and that the name &#8220;Jackson&#8221; is being passed to the function in its parenthesis. Modern JS says that IIFEs are useful in certain design patterns, like the module design pattern. That&#8217;s a topic that hasn&#8217;t been covered yet, where I am in the curriculum at Lambda and looks like it will be addressed in Modern JS in chapter 11.</p>\n<p>Finally, functions can be included inside of objects, instead of in the global scope &#8211; something we saw briefly when we looked at object literals. When a function is inside of an object, its called a <strong>method</strong> (hence, array methods, object methods, string methods, etc.).</p>\n<pre>const humanEraDeath {\n  guitarVox: 'Chuck Schuldiner',\n  guitar: 'Paul Masvidal',\n  bass: 'Steve DiGiorgio',\n  drums: 'Sean Reinert'\n  newMember: function(role, name){\n    console.log(role, name);\n}\n\nhumanEraDeath.newMember('Gene Hoglan', 'drums');</pre>\n<p>The above would simply console.log a new member of the band Death &#8211; but in this case, we&#8217;re not updating the object because the newMember method wasn&#8217;t written to do so, since the lineup during the Human album is already presented, and because Gene Hoglan played drums on the next album, Individual Thought Patterns, not on Human.</p>\n<p>We can also see that to call newMember, we have to do so from the humanEraDeath object, because its a method inside of that object. Oh, and additional methods can be added to the object from outside of the object by declaring them using dot notation, like this:</p>\n<pre>humanEraDeath.additionalInfo = function(year=1991, label='Relativity Records'){\n  console.log(<code>`Released: ${year} by ${label}</code>`);\n}</pre>\n<p>The Lambda pre-course had several sections dedicated to functions, and the main web developer course also went further into them. This lesson from Modern JS touched on declaring and calling functions, but didn&#8217;t dive into many of their other properties. I&#8217;m certain that subsequent lessons will explore this though.</p>\n<p>Some of what the Lambda pre-course covered includes anatomy of a function, passing data into a function, parameters, arguments, scope and the return statement. In the web developer course, JavaScript Fundamentals then added on arrow functions (including when not to use them), hoisting, anonymous functions, closure and callback functions. This will probably come later in Modern JS.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/26/lambda-school-pre-course-13-learn-why-we-use-javascript-functions-and-be-able-to-write-correct-function-syntax/\"><strong>Pre-course 13: Learn why we use JavaScript Functions and be able to write correct function syntax</strong></a></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/31/lambda-school-pre-course-14-learn-to-write-and-call-functions-using-arguments-and-parameters/\">Pre-course 14: Learn to write and call functions using arguments and parameters</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/31/lambda-school-pre-course-15-learn-to-explain-function-scope-and-the-return-statement/\">Pre-course 15: Learn to explain function scope and the return statement</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-1/\">Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 1</a></strong> (includes functions)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-2/\">Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 2</a></strong> (includes callback functions)</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1437\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1437\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1437\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/2-14-functions/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,943\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-14 functions\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1437\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=943\" alt=\"2-14 functions\" width=\"1680\" height=\"943\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=768&amp;h=431 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-14-functions.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=575 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1437\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Functions and methods</p></div>\n<h4>General Loops</h4>\n<p>This lesson focuses on loops and iteration. Modern JS describes a loop as a specific instruction that repeats until a condition is reached. It then tells us that the three most common loops are the <strong>for</strong> loop, <strong>while</strong> loop and the <strong>do while</strong> loop. They&#8217;re present in most programming languages. The lesson will also look at array-specific iteration with .forEach and .map, and the for/in statement, which is used to iterate through objects to get key/value pairs.</p>\n<p>We get an example of a <strong>for loop</strong>, which is something that was also available in the Lambda pre-course. Two interesting bits that weren&#8217;t in the Lambda material are the ability for the loop to do something different for a specific pass, and then breaking out of the loop.</p>\n<p>The first was illustrated by creating a loop that console.logs the numbers 0-9. However, when it loops through 2, it console.logs something else through an if statement that uses the === operator to determine if its reached a specific point in the loop. Then, it returns to looping, as normal.</p>\n<p>While doing this, it also console.logged 2, so it ran the if statement <em>in addition</em> to its usual output. By adding a <strong>&#8220;continue&#8221;</strong> statement, it skips that iteration of its regular loop and then continues on with 3. Its almost like an abridged &#8220;break&#8221; statement in that it stops the current loop and continues on, instead of stopping a function and exiting.</p>\n<p>The other interesting bit is actually the <strong>&#8220;break&#8221;</strong> statement, which causes the loop to stop and exit. It was also included in an if statement that uses the === operator to stop at a specific iteration and leave the loop.</p>\n<p>Next comes the <strong>while loop</strong>. A general piece of advice we&#8217;re given is to use a for loop when we know how many iterations the loop will go through, and to use a while loop when its unclear how many times a loop will need to repeat. My understanding is that a for loop runs for a specific count. A while loop runs until a specific condition is met.</p>\n<pre>let i = 0;\n\nwhile(i &lt; 100){\n  console.log(`<code>The count is ${i}</code>`);\ni++\n}</pre>\n<p>The <strong>do while loop</strong> differs from the while loop in that it will always run once, no matter what. A while loop might never run, if the condition to make it go isn&#8217;t present. From what I can see, this is due to the structure of the loop. The while loop starts by checking if a condition is met before it begins. Then it performs an action and increments its count. The do while loop, on the other hand, starts by performing an action, then increments its count, and lastly checks a condition to see if it should continue.</p>\n<pre>let i = 11\n\ndo {\n  console.log(`The count is ${i}`);\n  i++\n}\nwhile(i &lt; 10);</pre>\n<p>To close out the section, we look at array methods like <strong>.forEach</strong> and <strong>.map,</strong> which were also two of the first methods we learned at Lambda and the <strong>for/in</strong> loop, which is generally used with objects, to get data from key/value pairs. I know I&#8217;ve seen the for/in loop before, and I think I recall my original TL talking about it during a group standup, but I can&#8217;t remember if it was in the Lambda materials or if I came across it from an outside source while working on a project at Lambda.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/25/lambda-school-pre-course-11-learn-to-write-a-basic-for-loop/\">Pre-course 11: Learn to write a basic for loop</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-pre-course-23-learn-to-use-two-basic-array-methods-that-use-callbacks/\">Pre-course 23: Learn to use two basic array methods that use callbacks</a></strong> (.forEach &amp; .map)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/\">Lambda School: Full Stack – Unit 2, Sprint 5: Components I</a></strong> (.forEach &amp; .map)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1440\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/2-15-loops/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,943\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-15 loops\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1440\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=943\" alt=\"2-15 loops\" width=\"1680\" height=\"943\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=768&amp;h=431 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-15-loops.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=575 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /></p>\n<h4>A Look At The Window Object</h4>\n<p>When dealing with web development, the window (or browser) is the <em>global environment</em>. According to <a href=\"https://javascript.info/global-object\"><strong>JavaScript.info</strong></a>, the global object provides variables and functions that are available throughout a program. In the browser, the name for the global object is &#8220;window&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Modern JS shows us that if we type &#8220;window&#8221; in the console in the Chrome developer tools, we see an object called &#8220;window&#8221; that has dozens of methods, properties and objects (including &#8220;document&#8221; which is the heart of the DOM). Its basically everything that&#8217;s available to us in the browser. When we render web pages, its really the window object that&#8217;s performing all of the tasks needed to do anything onscreen.</p>\n<p>The pre-course makes no mention of it, but I remember being introduced to the document object and the window object when we started DOM manipulation at Lambda. It was overwhelming, the sheer number of properties and methods, and objects that had their own methods, that were available for use and for informational purposes. All of JavaScript is embedded in the global environment. Seeing it was like realizing that I was one out of billions of people on the earth, or that the earth was only a speck of dust in the cosmos. For purposes of rendering web pages and DOM manipulation, we were only concerned with a small subsection of what was available, but we were also encouraged to visit <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document\">MDN</a></strong> for more information about the rest of the document and global environment.</p>\n<p>After JavaScript Language Fundamentals, the next part of the Modern JS course deals with DOM manipulation and is likely akin to the Lambda curriculum. Lambda&#8217;s pre-course doesn&#8217;t have an introduction to this part of JavaScript. I&#8217;m up in the air about whether or not it should, because on the one hand, its a somewhat advanced topic, but on the other, its a key piece of web development technology. Maybe the idea of it should be included in the pre-course, just to put it in the back of new students&#8217; minds that this is even a concept. Regardless, here&#8217;s some of what Modern JS went over in this lesson:</p>\n<p>Some window methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.alert (produces a popup in the browser with a provided message)</li>\n<li>.prompt (like .alert, but takes an input, which is a user-typed string)</li>\n<li>.confirm (like alert, but with buttons to accept or reject onscreen prompt)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some window properties:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.outerheight (gives height of whole browser)</li>\n<li>.outerwidth (gives width of whole browser)</li>\n<li>innerheight (gives height of window, including scrollable area)</li>\n<li>.innerwidth (gives width of window, including scrollable area)</li>\n<li>.scrollY (shows where user is on the page with regard to scrolling vertically &#8211; good for triggering animations as specific points)</li>\n<li>.scrollX (like .scrollY, but horizontal)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some window objects and their methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.location (gives information about the current page/URL)\n<ul>\n<li>.hostname</li>\n<li>.port</li>\n<li>.href</li>\n<li>.search</li>\n<li>.reload()</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>.history (returns the browsing history, can be used to go to visited URLs)\n<ul>\n<li>.go()</li>\n<li>.length</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>.navigator (returns information about the browser program)\n<ul>\n<li>.appName</li>\n<li>.appVersion</li>\n<li>.userAgent</li>\n<li>.platform</li>\n<li>.vendor</li>\n<li>.language</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1443\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1443\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1443\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/24/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-3-of-3/2-16-document-object/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,940\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-16 document object\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1443\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=940\" alt=\"2-16 document object\" width=\"1680\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-16-document-object.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=573 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1443\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Methods of the Document object</p></div>\n<h4>Block Scope With let &amp; const</h4>\n<p>At last! The final video in JavaScript Language Fundamentals! It took a while to get here, as I watched this unit twice &#8211; once when I was initially going through it, and a 2nd time, on 1.5 speed, when I got the bright idea to blog about it and try and compare it to what we&#8217;ve covered at Lambda. So, I&#8217;ve effectively turned a 21-hour course into something like a 36-hour one. Yay&#8230;</p>\n<p>I am excited to get to the DOM section though.</p>\n<p>Anyway, block scope with let and const &#8211; scope is a topic that was covered at Lambda in both the pre-course and again, during the main web developer curriculum. Modern JS introduces it here, and it might get looked at again later on &#8211; we&#8217;ll learn that as we go through.</p>\n<p>The gist of it is this. There are three variable types in JavaScript: <strong>var, let</strong> and <strong>const</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>var</strong> is the original way of declaring a variable, and literally means &#8220;variable&#8221;. It has global scope, which means that a variable declared using var is the same variable throughout the program, except if the name is used again inside of a function, which has its own scope.</li>\n<li><strong>let</strong> is a little more restricted. It has block-level scope, which means that even in the global scope, if a &#8220;block&#8221; of code is created, like an if statement, for example, variables declared inside of that block of code using &#8220;let&#8221; are not the same as variables with the same name declared in the global scope.</li>\n<li><strong>const,</strong> like let, has block-level scope, in addition to not being directly alterable.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Global scope vs block-level scope looks like this:</p>\n<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>\n<pre>//Global Scope\n//Human-era lineup\nvar bassist = 'Steve DiGiorgio';\nlet drummer = 'Sean Reinert';\nconst guitarist = 'Paul Masvidal';\nconst guitarVox = 'Chuck Schuldiner';\n\nconsole.log('Human lineup: ', bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);</pre>\n<p>These variables are all in the global scope. They&#8217;re not inside of a function or block of code. There&#8217;s a var, let and a const. Output:</p>\n<pre>Human lineup: Steve DiGiorgio, Sean Reinert, Paul Masvidal, \n  Chuck Schuldiner</pre>\n<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>\n<pre>//Global Scope\n//Human-era lineup\nvar bassist = 'Steve DiGiorgio';\nlet drummer = 'Sean Reinert';\nconst guitarist = 'Paul Masvidal';\nconst guitarVox = 'Chuck Schuldiner';\n\nfunction symbolic(){\n  var bassist = 'Kelly Conlon';\n  let drummer = 'Gene Hoglan';\n  const guitarist = 'Bobby Koelble';\n  const guitarVox = 'Chuck Schuldiner'; \n\n  console.log('Symbolic lineup: ', \n    bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);\n}\n\nsymbolic();\nconsole.log('Human lineup: ', bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);</pre>\n<p>The global scope variables are still there. A function has been added. Functions have function-level scope, so even if variables in a function have the same name as variables from the global scope, they&#8217;re not the same variables. Output:</p>\n<pre>Symbolic lineup: Kelly Conlon, Gene Hoglan, Bobby Koelble, \n  Chuck Schuldiner\nHuman lineup: Steve Digiorgio, Sean Reinert, Paul Masvidal, \n  Chuck Schuldiner</pre>\n<p>Note that even though the variable names are the same (bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox) the output is different. The bassist, drummer and guitarist changed between Human and Symbolic. Even though some of these variables are &#8220;const&#8221; or fixed/unchanging and have the same name, they&#8217;re different variables based on scope. Variables inside a function are not the same as variables with the same name that are outside of a function (in this case, in the global scope).</p>\n<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>\n<pre>//Global Scope\n//Human-era lineup\nvar bassist = 'Steve DiGiorgio';\nlet drummer = 'Sean Reinert';\nconst guitarist = 'Paul Masvidal';\nconst guitarVox = 'Chuck Schuldiner';\n\nfunction symbolic(){\n  var bassist = 'Kelly Conlon';\n  let drummer = 'Gene Hoglan';\n  const guitarist = 'Bobby Koelble';\n  const guitarist = 'Chuck Schuldiner';  \n\n  console.log('Symbolic lineup: ', \n    bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);\n}\n\nif(true){\n  var bassist = 'Scott Clendenin';\n  let drummer = 'Richard Christy';\n  const guitarist = 'Shannon Hamm';\n  const guitarVox = 'Chuck Schuldiner';\n\n  console.log('The Sound of Perseverance lineup: ', \n    bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);\n}\n\nsymbolic();\nconsole.log('Human lineup: ', bassist, drummer, guitarist, guitarVox);</pre>\n<p>Ok. We&#8217;ve added an &#8220;if&#8221; statement in the main body of the code (not in a function) and set its value to true, so it&#8217;ll just execute. In this final example, output will run in this order:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If statement (block-level scope, The Sound of Perseverance album)</li>\n<li>Function (function-level scope, Symbolic album)</li>\n<li>Global (global-level scope, Human album)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Our output would look like this:</p>\n<pre>The Sound of Perseverance lineup: Scott Clendenin, Richard Christy, \n  Shannon Hamm, Chuck Schuldiner\nSymbolic lineup: Kelly Conlon, Gene Hoglan, Bobby Koelble, \n  Chuck Schuldiner\nHuman lineup: Scott Clendenin, Sean Reinert, Paul Masvidal, \n  Chuck Schuldiner</pre>\n<p>What we&#8217;re noting here is that in the Human-era lineup, Steve Digiorgio has been changed to Scott Clendenin. Why is this? Its because that &#8220;if&#8221; statement is a code block and let and const have block-level scope, so any variables declared inside of that code block using let or const are only available inside of the block. Var, on the other hand has global scope. A variable declared in a block of code using var is the same as a variable declared globally. The only exception, of course, is a variable declared in a function.</p>\n<p>In this case, &#8220;bassist&#8221; is declared as a var, so the &#8220;bassist&#8221; variable inside of the &#8220;if&#8221; statement is the same as the one declared globally, at the start of the code. So, we get the wrong bassist for the Human album. If &#8220;bassist&#8221; was declared as a const, it would have given us an error, because we can&#8217;t change the value of a const.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/31/lambda-school-pre-course-15-learn-to-explain-function-scope-and-the-return-statement/\">Pre-course 15: Learn to explain function scope and the return statement</a></strong></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-1/\"><strong>Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 1</strong></a> (scope is in the lesson.

These were questions that I&#8217;ve wondered about, as well. Ultimately, I decided to go with a bootcamp (Lambda School) because of the structure of the classes, the network available for help and accountability, and the resources available for career coaching &#8211; resume help, portfolio help, general counsel regarding job searches, etc. Lambda&#8217;s ISA (Income Share Agreement) was the deciding factor in my going with them, plus their curriculum seemed more in-depth that many other bootcamps I looked at.</p>\n<p>Since going through HTML/CSS, JavaScript, React and parts of Redux and other things at Lambda, my discovery (which might only apply to myself, and not necessarily anyone else &#8211; maybe its a block-level thought then, not a global one) is that it IS possible to self-teach coding using resources available online, but that process would be difficult and time-consuming for those who are not strongly self-driven and who have any issues with adequacy or self-esteem. This is taking into account that its a difficult process even before going it alone.</p>\n<p>That said, I switched from full-time to part-time at Lambda, and even now, I&#8217;m on a 6-week hiatus from part-time while I go through JavaScript and React materials myself, before my (hopefully) triumphant return to the fold. Learning at someone else&#8217;s pace &#8211; in this case the cohort&#8217;s pace &#8211; is not the same as learning at your own pace. Udemy courses, books, websites &#8211; going through materials delivered in these formats allows us to progress at a comfortable pace. We can review material at our discretion. There&#8217;s less time-driven stress than that which comes with trying to keep up with a coding bootcamp (and possibly a school). The stresses are still real though, and staying motivated can also become a bigger issue in solitary confinement.</p>\n<p>My balance, so far, has been to take time off in-between large units at Lambda, to use what I&#8217;ve learned and review material that I&#8217;m not as strong with. We&#8217;re not allowed to take a hiatus more than once, so this will be my sole one. We can, however, stretch time before returning, if we flex to a new cohort, which I did the first time I flexed.</p>\n<p>Lambda is something like shock therapy to me. The pace and the deluge of projects and exercises takes me out of my comfort zone and forces me to try to learn and absorb information. Backing away from it to practicing what I&#8217;ve been exposed to, and making use of outside resources like this course from Brad Traversy, is the counterbalance. It lets me methodically take apart a concept, analyze it and learn in a more controlled manner. I&#8217;m not young anymore, and I think I&#8217;m now something of a slow learner, so these breaks are vital to me, for really driving home new concepts.</p>\n<p>For people like myself, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a single path to learning. I think that using complimentary resources to advance is a strong option. I really admire people who are able to absorb and use this material with their first pass, but ultimately, its not a race. Its really about building proficiency. I&#8217;m happy to be alive in an age in which all of this is even an option. When I graduated high school, in the early 1990s, bootcamps weren&#8217;t a thing. The internet wasn&#8217;t anything like it is today, college computer science degrees taught COBOL and Fortran and I didn&#8217;t have a clear idea of how to learn what I needed to become a programmer. I wanted to write games for Sega. There was no roadmap to that. Schools still looked down on gaming as a waste of time. Now, the world is a different place. Gaming is the largest money-maker in the entertainment industry, and I actually don&#8217;t want to be a game programmer anymore. I want to build web applications, and I want to further causes that I align with.</p>\n<p>Anyway, my big takeaway is that all of these resources are a blessing. Try and determine a path forward using them, if you&#8217;re interested in web development. Talk to people online, and to any programmers you might know in real life. Last year, I reached out to people on Reddit and got good advice, in spite of the site&#8217;s sometimes troubling reputation. Try out front-end and back-end coding, to see what you like. You might surprise yourself and favor one over the other, or you might actually find that you enjoy building projects from soup-to-nuts.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to be said about the job market, domestically and internationally, but my perception is that its growing, and that there are programmers who are capable and have foresight and experience, and there are those who are less proficient or who have stagnated. There&#8217;s room for more of us. The field is expanding. There are sub-fields still waiting to be created (I work in a field that didn&#8217;t exist when my parents were born). Thank to Lambda for showing me that this is even possible, and for creating a model that makes it available to a large swath of people who want to learn to code and become developers; and thanks to Brad Traversy for proving that people can overcome overwhelming adversity in life and become empowering figures who help to guide others through their learning and experiences.</p>\n<p>I hope we all succeed.</p>\n<p>This post should have been two posts. I need to plan a little more in the future.</p>\n<p>Ok. I&#8217;m going to work through the DOM material next.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This is the last of 3 posts dealing with JavaScript Fundamentals from Brad Traversy‘s Modern JavaScript From the Beginning course on Udemy.

2nd of 3 posts dealing with <strong>JavaScript Fundamentals</strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb\">Brad Traversy</a></strong>‘s <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/\">Modern JavaScript From the Beginning</a></strong> course on <strong>Udemy</strong>. It compares the course with <strong><a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda</a></strong> material, from the pre-course and the full-stack developer track. (<em>See part 1 <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/\"><strong>here</strong></a>.</em>)</p>\n<h4>Numbers &amp; The Math Object</h4>\n<p>This section races through the Math object in JavaScript. Simple math, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus are handled without use of the Math object. Its methods come into play for other calculations, including pi, rounding up or down, square roots, absolute values, exponentials, finding the minimum or maximum value in an array, generating a random number, and other functions.</p>\n<p>The pre-course at Lambda gave examples of Math.pow, Math.round, Math.floor and Math.ceil. Modern JS gives examples of quite a few more, including using more than one at the same time (using &#8220;Math.floor(Math.random() * 20 + 1)&#8221; to generate a random integer between the numbers 1-20, which is probably fantastic for D&amp;D players). I don&#8217;t recall going over additional Math methods during the main course at Lambda, so with regard to this topic, Modern JS gives examples of roughly 3X the number of Math methods as Lambda, although we&#8217;re generally advised to consult <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript\"><strong>MDN</strong></a> for additional information, since this is something frequently done by developers out in the wild.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/19/lambda-school-full-stack-web-development-pre-course-8/\">Pre-course 8: Learn to use Math, Properties, Methods and Global Objects in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1395\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1395\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1395\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/2-6-math/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-6 math\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1395\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-6 math\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-6-math.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1395\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Using the Math object in JavaScript</p></div>\n<h4>String Methods &amp; Concatenation</h4>\n<p>This lesson goes over concatenation, appending, escaping and then a series of string methods (some of which are also array methods).</p>\n<p>Concatenation links or joins together two or more things. In JavaScript, concatenating 5 and 6 gives us 56. Concatenating &#8220;Alex&#8221; and &#8220;Webster&#8221; gives us &#8220;AlexWebster&#8221;, with no space in between. If we want a space, we have to concatenate that in, as well.</p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:40px;\">name = firstName + ' ' + lastName; //concatenation</pre>\n<p>Appending looks similar to concatenation in output, but is expressed through the += operator. Appending &#8220;Steve &#8221; += &#8220;Digiorgio&#8221; gives us &#8220;Steve Digiorgio&#8221;.</p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:40px;\">name = \"Steve \";\nname += \"DiGiorgio\";\nSteve DiGiorgio //appending</pre>\n<p>Escaping is new to me. Its not something that was covered at Lambda. Escaping essentially turns special characters into strings, so that they can be included in whatever needs to process or output a string with said character. The escape character is a &#8220;\\&#8221;. For example:</p>\n<pre style=\"padding-left:40px;\">names = 'J'onn J'onnz, Hawai'i, Muad'Dib, T'Challa, Drizzt Do'urden' //this will throw errors\nnames = 'J\\'onn J\\'onnz, Hawai\\'i, Muad\\'Dib, T\\'Challa, Drizzt Do\\'urden' //works\nnames = \"J'onn J'onnz, Hawai'i, Muad'Dib, T'Challa, Drizzt Do'urden\" //also works</pre>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_strings.asp\"><strong>w3schools</strong></a> has a section that explains escape characters some more. To my eye, when possible, enclosing the line with single quotes in double quotes seems to be the simplest way to go. In a situation in which both single and double quotes are used in the actual text or data, I can see how escape characters can save the day, however.</p>\n<p>Additional topics discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.length method</li>\n<li>.concat method</li>\n<li>.toUpperCase method</li>\n<li>.toLowerCase method</li>\n<li>treating a string like an array (firstName[3] returns the 4th letter in a name &#8211; they start at 0, like arrays)</li>\n<li>.indexOf</li>\n<li>.lastIndexOf</li>\n<li>.charAt</li>\n<li>getting the last character in a string: firstName.charAt(firstName.length -1);</li>\n<li>.subString</li>\n<li>.slice</li>\n<li>.split</li>\n<li>.replace</li>\n<li>.includes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At Lambda, I remember seeing .length, .toUpperCase, .toLowerCase, .slice, .split and .includes. As mentioned before though, we were always advised to refer to MDN or w3schools to learn about additional methods, so I &#8220;unofficially&#8221; saw other methods, especially during sprint challenges.</p>\n<p>During the JavaScript Fundamentals sprint at Lambda, I remember we went pretty hard into all kinds of methods, especially those for sorting and pulling out specific pieces of data from arrays and objects. There were exercises and challenges that stumped me for hours every day during that week.</p>\n<p>That particular sprint is especially intimidating for people new to coding, as it moves from early concepts like variables, arrays, objects and functions to more difficult concepts like closure, callback functions, advanced array methods, &#8220;this&#8221;, prototypes, constructor functions, &#8220;new&#8221;, pseudo-classical inheritance and classes. After that, we&#8217;d have our first Build Week and then move into DOM manipulation and JavaScript components. Many students end up flexing into another cohort to repeat that section, and I nearly did it too. Its the sprint that really put the fear of not being able to grasp basic programming concepts into me. Getting over that can only be done by overcoming the obstacle, though, so I&#8217;m glad that its also all in this course. One piece of advice that floats around at Lambda is that if a concept is giving you trouble, you probably need &#8220;more reps&#8221;. To me, that&#8217;s essentially what this entire Modern JS course is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-5-sprint-challenge/\"><strong>Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 5: Sprint Challenge</strong></a></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1397\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1397\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1397\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/2-7-string-methods/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-7 string methods\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1397\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-7 string methods\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-7-string-methods.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1397\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">String methods in JavaScript</p></div>\n<h4>Template Literals</h4>\n<p>I love template literals. They&#8217;ve helped me clean up my code quite a bit and include variables in places in which I didn&#8217;t previously know how to do so. Sometimes, in React, when writing JSX, I&#8217;ve confused myself a bit while using them, but overall they&#8217;ve added a lot of flexibility to my code.</p>\n<p>So, what are they? They&#8217;re strings of data that are encapsulated by backticks instead of single or double quotes. Inside of these strings, variables, expressions or even functions can be included by surrounding them with a dollar-sign and curly braces, like this: ${variableName}. Here&#8217;s how that concatenation example from the previous section could look using template literals (also called string literals):</p>\n<pre>name = firstName + ' ' + lastName; //concatenation\nname = `${firstName} ${lastName}`; //string literal</pre>\n<p>Note that we no longer need to have the plus signs and the apostrophes surrounding a space. This is because the string literal reads the space between the two variables as a space and just includes it. Its especially useful for React. I use it inside of JSX all the time. I also used it a lot when I was code to manipulate the DOM in JavaScript and needed it to render the values of data being looped through in arrays or objects into HTML.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t remember when we learned about string literals at Lambda, and a search in the JavaScript Fundamentals material and the Applied JavaScript material shows object literals, but not string literals or template literals. I do remember my original TL, Reed, going over them with us, so maybe it was something that he showed us, and not something that was covered in the curriculum, but I recall using them on a sprint challenge and in my portfolio, and then in React. I also know that I used them when we learned about components in JavaScript, because its been a habit since.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1402\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1402\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1402\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/2-8-template-literals/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,942\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-8 template literals\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1402\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=942\" alt=\"2-8 template literals\" width=\"1680\" height=\"942\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=768&amp;h=431 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-8-template-literals.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1402\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Template literals (also called string literals)</p></div>\n<h4>Arrays &amp; Array Methods</h4>\n<p>This video starts off by briefly describing what an array is and then showing viewers how to create one in two different ways &#8211; by simply creating a variable and setting it to an array of some sort of data, and by using the &#8220;new Array&#8221; constructor. We see how an array can hold different types of data, like an array of numbers or an array of strings, and we see how it can hold a variety of different types of data all at once by seeing an array that has data from every data type we&#8217;ve seen so far.</p>\n<p>Then, it dives right into array methods and properties, including the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.length (how long is an array, or how many elements does it contain)</li>\n<li>Array.isArray() (is the item in the parenthesis actually an array)</li>\n<li>getting a single value based on an element&#8217;s array index (num = numbers[2];)</li>\n<li>inserting data into an array via array index (numbers[3] = 213;)</li>\n<li>.push (add to end of array)</li>\n<li>.unshift (add to beginning of array)</li>\n<li>.pop (remove from end of array)</li>\n<li>.shift (remove from beginning of array)</li>\n<li>.splice (remove an element or a range of elements from an array)</li>\n<li>.reverse (reorders an array backwards)</li>\n<li>.concat (combine two arrays into a single array)</li>\n<li>.sort (rearranges an array&#8217;s elements in alphabetical order if strings; if numbers it sorts based on first number, so 100 would come before 2 &#8211; to fix this we&#8217;d include a &#8220;compare function&#8221; that could look like the below code)\n<pre>sorted = numbers.sort(function(x, y) {\n  return x - y;\n});</pre>\n</li>\n<li>sort numbers in the other direction by returning &#8220;y &#8211; x&#8221; instead of &#8220;x &#8211; y&#8221;</li>\n<li>writing a &#8220;finding function&#8221;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some of the array methods from this video were also included in the Lambda material. .length, .push, .pop, .unshift and .shift were all introduced during the pre-course.

From what I can infer, it seems to be a single object.</p>\n<pre>const humanEraDeath {\n  guitarVox: 'Chuck Schuldiner',\n  guitar: 'Paul Masvidal',\n  bass: 'Steve DiGiorgio',\n  drums: 'Sean Reinert'\n}</pre>\n<p>Where arrays tend to contain a set of data that are essentially each elements of their own, objects tend to contain a set of data about the same thing. Think of an array of people, each with their full names &#8211; each of these could even be an object, itself. An object, on the other hand would be <em>one</em> of these people, potentially with deeper data, like first name, last name, address, email, phone number, and so on. Arrays can contain objects (like if each of the people in our array above was an object with all of the data from the object example that followed), and objects can contain arrays (like if the phone number in each person&#8217;s object included entries for home, cell and work numbers).</p>\n<p>This lesson shows viewers how to create an object literal, and then how to get a specific value from that object &#8211; like a person&#8217;s first name or last name &#8211; using <strong>dot notation</strong> and then <strong>bracket notation</strong>. It also goes over how to get data out of a nested array inside of an object, something that gave me a considerable amount of trouble during a sprint challenge that had something like an array of objects that each had an array of more data as one of their key-value pairs. If I remember right, it turned out that I needed to use bracket notation, and I had wasted a lot of time failing to get the data I needed with dot notation.</p>\n<p>It also shows something that I found interesting: functions inside of an object. I think we did go over this at Lambda, but I haven&#8217;t used it since being introduced to it, except maybe when we worked with prototypes or some other constructor.</p>\n<p>Finally, it closes by showing how to iterate over an array of objects, which is exactly what I had trouble with during one of the sprint challenges at Lambda.</p>\n<p>I think that the big differentiator between this lesson and what we learned at Lambda is that this particular lesson focuses on creating an object and then reading data from it, whereas Lambda&#8217;s pre-course went a bit further in. The pre-course explained object definition, key-value pairs, and how to access data via dot or bracket notation, like here, but then forged ahead to include assigning values, removing properties, methods, for/in loops and the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword. We also learn that everything in JavaScript is an object &#8211; even arrays and strings are actually objects!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/02/lambda-school-pre-course-18-learn-to-use-objects-to-store-and-access-data/\">Pre-course 18: Learn to use objects to store and access data</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/02/lambda-school-pre-course-19-learn-to-create-methods-on-objects-and-utilize-the-this-keyword/\">Pre-course 19: Learn to create methods on Objects, and utilize the ‘this’ keyword</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-1/\">Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 1</a></strong> (includes objects)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/31/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-3/\"><strong>Lambda School: Full Stack – Week 3, Day 3</strong></a> (includes the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword)</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1412\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1412\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1412\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/2-10-objects/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,942\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-10 objects\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1412\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=942\" alt=\"2-10 objects\" width=\"1680\" height=\"942\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=768&amp;h=431 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-10-objects.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1412\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">An object literal</p></div>\n<h4>Dates &amp; Times</h4>\n<p>Dates and time in JavaScript are new to me. I don&#8217;t think we covered this at Lambda so far, so this is uncharted territory. From this video, it seems fairly straightforward. Dates are objects and they contain the date (month, day year) and a timestamp, including time zone.</p>\n<p>Dates can be converted from objects to string with the .toString method. Calling a new date (new Date()) returns the current date and time. A specific date can also be called or assigned to a variable by specifying it in the parenthesis of the Date() function. This can be done in several formats:</p>\n<pre>const birthday = new Date('5-17-1975');\nconst birthday = new Date('5-17-1975 07:15:00');\nconst birthday = new Date('May 17 1975');\nconst birthday = new Date('5/17/1975');</pre>\n<p>Several methods were also reviewed, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>.getMonth() (returns the month as an integer &#8211; it starts at 0 for January, not 1)</li>\n<li>.getDate() (returns the date of the month, so May 17th would return 17)</li>\n<li>.getDay() (returns the day as an integer, with Sunday being 0)</li>\n<li>.getFullYear() (returns the year as a 4-digit integer)</li>\n<li>.getHours() (returns the hour of the day, so 7:00 AM would return 7)</li>\n<li>.getMinutes() (returns the minute of the hour, so 7:30 AM would return 30)</li>\n<li>.getSeconds() (returns the second of the minute)</li>\n<li>.getMilliseconds() (returns the <em>millisecond</em> of the second, for those who waste no time)</li>\n<li>.getTime() (returns a timestamp, which is the number of seconds that has passed since January 1, 1970!)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most of these methods have complimentary methods that can set their data as well. To do this, just change the .get in each method to .set. For example, .setMonth(2) sets the month to March (0 = Jan, 1 = Feb, 2 = March).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date\">Mozilla Developer Network: Date</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1416\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1416\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1416\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/21/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-2-of-3/2-11-dates-and-time/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,940\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-11 dates and time\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1416\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=940\" alt=\"2-11 dates and time\" width=\"1680\" height=\"940\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-11-dates-and-time.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=573 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1416\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Date and time methods</p></div>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>This is the 2nd of 3 posts dealing with JavaScript Fundamentals from Brad Traversy‘s Modern JavaScript From the Beginning course on Udemy.

To that end, I grabbed <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TechGuyWeb\">Brad Traversy</a></strong>&#8216;s <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/\">Modern JavaScript From the Beginning</a></strong> and his <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/\">React Front to Back</a></strong> courses on <strong>Udemy</strong>. Yesterday morning, I completed the 2nd unit of the JavaScript course, which dealt with <strong>JavaScript Fundamentals</strong>. Here&#8217;s how it went, and a comparison with what I learned at Lambda so far.</p>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Brad&#8217;s course consists of the following units:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1361\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/course-contents/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"772,861\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"course-contents\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=269\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=772\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1361\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=772&#038;h=861\" alt=\"course-contents\" width=\"772\" height=\"861\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg 772w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=134&amp;h=150 134w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=269&amp;h=300 269w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/course-contents.jpg?w=768&amp;h=857 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 772px) 100vw, 772px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Intro &amp; Getting Started</strong> covered setting up <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and some extensions, course-specific resources available on <strong>GitHub</strong> and a general overview of how the course works. It was similar to material from Lambda&#8217;s first week of class. Lambda&#8217;s coverage was much more in-depth, because we spent more time on learning how to use GitHub in a basic manner which would allow us to clone projects from the site, create our own branches, upload changes, make pull requests, add collaborators, merge to master and so on. I&#8217;m not sure yet if Modern JS will delve deeper into GitHub.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/07/simplified-git-instructions-for-lambda-school-students/\">“Simplified” git instructions for Lambda School students</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>With regard to VS Code, there were some differences. I don&#8217;t remember Lambda officially going over extensions, but in our individual groups, our TLs did that with us and recommended extensions that we could install. Students and other TLs also shared additional extensions in Slack. Modern JS did go over some shortcuts, which I don&#8217;t remember doing at Lambda, but I do remember seeing before in other YouTube videos. I&#8217;ll see about making a short post with some shortcuts that I use later.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/10/vs-code-extensions/\">VS Code extensions</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>JavaScript Language Fundamentals</h3>\n<p>This unit consisted of the following topics. Each had their own video, and a downloadable ZIP file that included HTML and JS code.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section Intro &amp; File Setup</li>\n<li>Using The Console</li>\n<li>Variables &#8211; var, let &amp; const</li>\n<li>Data Types in JavaScript</li>\n<li>Type Conversion</li>\n<li>Numbers &amp; The Math Object</li>\n<li>String Methods &amp; Concatenation</li>\n<li>Template Literals</li>\n<li>Arrays &amp; Array Methods</li>\n<li>Object Literals</li>\n<li>Dates &amp; Times</li>\n<li>If Statements &amp; Comparison Operators</li>\n<li>Switches</li>\n<li>Function Declarations &amp; Expressions</li>\n<li>General Loops</li>\n<li>A Look At The Window Object</li>\n<li>Block Scope With let &amp; const</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My initial impression of the content, after going through it once, is that its better-digested after learning some of this elsewhere &#8211; maybe even on Brad&#8217;s YouTube channel. Having gone through Lambda&#8217;s pre-course and then <strong>JavaScript Fundamentals</strong> (sprint 3) and <strong>Applied JavaScript</strong> (sprint 5), much of what I saw in this unit wasn&#8217;t new to me, and I was able to follow along with no issues. I do think that people completely new to JavaScript will be a little overwhelmed, because although the topics are all examined on a high-level, there are no exercises for these lessons. The videos are purely informational and actually could have been a general YouTube video refresher series.</p>\n<p>With Lambda, we were required<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\"> to complete and submit exercises and projects that directly utilized the JavaScript topics that we learned every day. I know that projects will come later on in Modern JS, but going through essentially 3.25 hours of videos without doing any coding doesn&#8217;t drill these fundamental concepts into our heads the same way. I think that some basic exercises should be included for each of these sections, if its revised in the future. That said, there were some topics covered in this unit that weren&#8217;t covered at this stage at Lambda, and some topics also included details that weren&#8217;t part of the coursework at Lambda. I&#8217;ll delve into these in the given topic&#8217;s section, below.</span></p>\n<h4>Section Intro &amp; File Setup</h4>\n<p>This opening video introduces us to JavaScript by listing some of the topics that the section will cover and goes over setting up the coding environment. With VS Code installed, all that the sandbox environment requires is an index.html file and a JavaScript file. It also shows how to include script files, both internally and externally in the HTML file.</p>\n<p>One of the shortcuts used in VS Code is typing &#8220;!&#8221; and hitting the &#8220;tab&#8221; key to get a boilerplate HTML file. This is only available if Emmet is installed in VS Code, which I think is the case, by default. We&#8217;re also shown how to run Live Server, so that changes to our code are automatically made in the browser&#8217;s output when changes are saved in VS Code.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1367\" style=\"width: 1170px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1367\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1367\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/2-1-boilerplate-html/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1160,938\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-1 boilerplate html\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1367\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=1160&#038;h=938\" alt=\"2-1 boilerplate html\" width=\"1160\" height=\"938\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg 1160w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=150&amp;h=121 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=300&amp;h=243 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=768&amp;h=621 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-1-boilerplate-html.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=828 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1160px) 100vw, 1160px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1367\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Boilerplate HTML, courtesy of Emmet (! + tab)</p></div>\n<h4>Using The Console</h4>\n<p>The developer console is a tool built into Chrome that contains information about a given web page. It has multiple tabs, which each house different scopes of information. One of these tabs is the Console, which is a browser-based command line tool. It shows the output of code, like JavaScript, on a web page and can even be used to write JavaScript code, although it can&#8217;t save, so once a page is refreshed, any changes made in the console are lost. Because of this, its primarily used for testing and debugging.</p>\n<p>Both Modern JS and Lambda&#8217;s full-stack precourse show how to open the console in Chrome with the F12 key. I don&#8217;t remember either giving a deep explanation about what the console is, though. In Applied JavaScript, at Lambda, when we learned about DOM manipulation, we did look at the console more in-depth, including examining the Document.</p>\n<p>Modern JS gave some examples of writing and immediately executing JavaScript in the console, but this included more advanced commands, like query selectors and changing the color of an h1 on the screen via DOM manipulation. Some of this jumping around could be intimidating to new students who have little or no experience coding. I know that if I had seen some of the DOM manipulation when first starting, I would have been confused.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, although both the Lambda pre-course and Modern JS have us console.log in the Chrome browser, neither one explains what console.log is. We see its output, in either case, but its not actually explained to us what it means, initially. Modern JS does console.log a variety of different types of data in this lesson, including a string, number, boolean, variable, array and object.</p>\n<p>Here are some additional topics discussed in Modern JS:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>single-line comments</li>\n<li>multi-line comments</li>\n<li>changing console text size with control-mousewheel</li>\n<li>console.table()</li>\n<li>console.error()</li>\n<li>console.clear()</li>\n<li>console.warn()</li>\n<li>console.time()</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1372\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1372\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1372\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/2-2-console/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-2 console\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1372\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-2 console\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-2-console.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1372\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Using the developer console in Chrome</p></div>\n<h4>Variables &#8211; var, let &amp; const</h4>\n<p>This video introduces variables in JavaScript and mentions block-level scope, but then defers scope to the last video in this section, because functions and code blocks haven&#8217;t yet been covered. It shows how to declare a variable and how to console.log the value of that variable, then reassigns the value of the variable, showing how the newer value overwrites the old one. The concept of a string data type is introduced, but also deferred to the next section, which covers data types in detail.</p>\n<p>We see how to initialize a variable (create one and not give it a value) and how that gives it a default value of &#8220;undefined&#8221; until its assigned a new value. We&#8217;re then told that one of the reasons that variables are sometimes initialized but not given an initial value is to support conditional statements (like an if/then statement) which executes different code blocks based on the value of a variable.</p>\n<p>Variable names can include letters, numbers, underscores and dollar signs. They can&#8217;t begin with a number &#8211; doing so results in an error in the console. I don&#8217;t remember Lambda mentioning underscores and dollar signs, so that was something new. I think the rest was covered in the pre-course. Modern JS cautions against starting a variable name with a dollar sign or an underscore. Beginning with a dollar sign is something usually reserved for JQuery and and starting with an underscore is generally used for private variables, a concept I&#8217;m not yet familiar with.</p>\n<p>Some naming conventions are covered, like camel case, Pascal case (which I&#8217;ve heard called Snake case, as well), underscore and all lowercase. Lambda mentioned some of these as well, and both recommend camel case, with Pascal case being used for certain things, like constructor functions &#8211; which is a common convention among JavaScript coders.</p>\n<p>We&#8217;re shown how var and let operate similarly when it comes to reassigning values to a variable, and how const is not only fixed, but must be assigned when a const is declared. We then see how values in an object literal that are assigned to a const can be changed and introduced to the idea that if a const is set to reference an object, that can&#8217;t be changed, but the data inside of the object can change (or mutate). The const remains unchanged (its still pointed to the same object) but the actual values of data inside of the given object can change. This will go over the heads of absolute beginners, as objects are then deferred to a later video. I remember Lambda going deep into the value of different variables and constants, especially when set to objects and arrays, later in the course &#8211; possibly during Advanced State Management, which is the 4th sprint focused on React.</p>\n<p>Both Lambda and Modern JS recommend declaring all variables as const, unless they need to change, then use let.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1376\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1376\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1376\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/2-3-variables/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,941\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-3 variables\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1376\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=941\" alt=\"2-3 variables\" width=\"1680\" height=\"941\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=768&amp;h=430 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-3-variables.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1376\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Variables and naming conventions</p></div>\n<h4>Data Types in JavaScript</h4>\n<p>This video looks at the types of data that are stored in variables. It goes over primitive data types, which is data that is accessed directly by its value, and reference data types, which is data that is not stored directly where its accessed, but is essentially pointed to. I don&#8217;t know the technical details of each of these yet, but the types associated with each are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><strong>Primitive:</strong> String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined and Symbols (ES6)</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><strong>Reference:</strong> Arrays, Object literals, Functions, Dates</p>\n<p>JavaScript is a &#8220;dynamically typed&#8221; language. This doesn&#8217;t mean that we type commands dynamically &#8211; its about data types. It means that the &#8220;type&#8221; of variable is based on the data assigned to it, not the other way around. Other programming languages have developers specify a variable type when the variable is created, like declaring a variable named num and immediately setting it to hold only integer values. JavaScript doesn&#8217;t set a type to a variable until data is put into it. For example, we could theoretically have a variable named num and then place a string like &#8220;Hello&#8221; in it. Its now a string variable.</p>\n<p>But that&#8217;s not all. We could later assign a value of 30 to num, and it would overwrite the &#8220;Hello&#8221; value with the value of 30 and change the type from string to number. This is something that really bewildered me when I first learned it in the Lambda pre-course, and then again in the Modern JS course.</p>\n<p>The opposite of this, s<em>tatically-typed</em> languages, is what I was familiar with in high school, back in the 1990s. In Pascal, for example, an integer variable could only ever hold an integer value. It couldn&#8217;t even hold a different number type, like a decimal value.</p>\n<p>Additional topics discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>typeof (shows the data type of a variable)</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1382\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1382\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1382\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/2-4-data-types/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,942\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-4 data types\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1382\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=942\" alt=\"2-4 data types\" width=\"1680\" height=\"942\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=768&amp;h=431 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2-4-data-types.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=574 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1382\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Data types being displayed by typeof</p></div>\n<h4>Type Conversion</h4>\n<p>Type conversion is the process of taking data of one type and converting it into another. What I&#8217;ve seen mainly consists of turning numbers into strings, and vice versa. To turn a number into a string, the number is simply wrapped in the String() function. So, for example, to turn the number 213 into a string, we could use the String(213) command. If we then check it with typeof(), we&#8217;ll see that its type is no longer &#8220;number&#8221; but has been converted to &#8220;string&#8221;. Its .length will also change from &#8220;undefined&#8221;, which is the .length for all numbers since .length is a string method,  to 3, because 213 has 3 characters.</p>\n<p>We also get a quick example of type coercion, which is similar to type conversion. Both change the type of a variable to another type. The difference is that coercion is implicit and conversion can be either implicit or explicit. This isn&#8217;t explained in the video, but in this case <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion\"><strong>Mozilla</strong></a> had some of the answer.</p>\n<p>Additional topics discussed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>String() function (converts data to a string, numbers gain a length. Dates become a string with the date, time and time zone.)</li>\n<li>.toString method (same as String () function)</li>\n<li>typeof function</li>\n<li>.length method</li>\n<li>.toFixed method (turns a string into a number &#8211; number of decimal spaces can be specified. Booleans gain a value of 1 for true and 0 for false. Null values become 0. Strings and arrays gain a value of NaN, which means Not A Number.)</li>\n<li>parseInt function (returns an integer value)</li>\n<li>parseFloat function (returns a decimal value)</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_1384\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1384\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1384\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/20/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning-section-2-javascript-language-fundamentals-1-of-3/3-5-type-conversion/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,939\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"3-5 type conversion\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1384\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=939\" alt=\"3-5 type conversion\" width=\"1680\" height=\"939\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=768&amp;h=429 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/3-5-type-conversion.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=572 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-1384\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Converting a date to string</p></div>\n<p>Ok. This post is getting long, so I&#8217;m going to break it into 3 parts and cover the remaining topics from JavaScript Fundamentals. Here&#8217;s an index of posts about Lambda&#8217;s pre-course.

School update: I&#8217;m flexing again.","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/16/lambda-school-update-im-flexing-again/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-lH","content":"<p>Its been a rough few weeks, with regard to coding. <strong>React</strong> was harder than I thought it was going to be. I understand the concepts, but for some reason, I&#8217;m not able to implement it on my own very capably. I fell behind with projects at Lambda several weeks ago and also ran into a wall with updating my portfolio. Its mostly converted to React and uses switch statements to render components, instead of refreshing the entire screen, but I haven&#8217;t puzzled out how to make my projects render programmatically through props &#8211; right now, I have the same set of projects rendering for each of the three categories viewers can click on. I think I&#8217;m misunderstanding how to set up child components of particular parents. I could just do it in JavaScript with DOM manipulation, but that defeats the purpose of converting it to React and taking advantage of JSX.</p>\n<p>My cohort made it through Advanced React and into Advanced State Management. We tackled <strong>Context API</strong>. the <strong>reducer pattern</strong>, <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>Async Redux</strong> (along with class components, component lifecycle and methods, testing and more) but I really need to just do it all again. So, I&#8217;m taking a 6-week hiatus from Lambda and returning on March 9th, which is my mother&#8217;s birthday, so it must be a sign. 😉 I&#8217;ll be moving from WEBPT10 to WEBPT14. They&#8217;ll be starting Intro to React, so I&#8217;ll get to do it over &#8211; with <em>feeling.</em></p>\n<p>In the meantime, I grabbed <strong>Brad Traversy</strong>&#8216;s <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/\">Modern JavaScript From the Beginning</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/\">React Front to Back</a></strong> , both on <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/\">Udemy</a></strong>. The React course was a recommendation from my new TL (team lead) in WEBPT10. My previous TL, Angel, got promoted last week and I think is now a SL (section lead). When I spoke with my new one, Wes, he told me about his challenges with React (he took it twice too, but it was because his entire cohort was allowed to repeat it since they learned class components and the React team had just released Hooks, which were then incorporated into Lambda&#8217;s curriculum). He said that on hindsight, he should have just flexed, but he pushed through and made it out with an incomplete understanding. Taking it again really helped him, and now he&#8217;s actually going through it a 3rd time, because he&#8217;s doing the material as we get it, so he can help us with projects, as needed &#8211; well, not me, anymore, since I&#8217;m on hiatus, but I can always reach out to him if necessary.</p>\n<p>Anyway, Wes recommended the React course because it goes over just about all of React. It includes projects built using class components, and then converts them to hooks, which really solidifies the process and differentiates the technologies. I also like Traversy quite a bit. I watch his channel a lot, along with some other developer-focused channels on YouTube. When I went to Udemy and grabbed the React course, I took a quick look at his other courses and decided to grab the JavaScript one as well, because my JavaScript is not very strong yet. Its all vanilla JS, so my hope is that I come out the other side of this with a much more practical understanding of it than I currently have.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1352\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2020/01/16/lambda-school-update-im-flexing-again/footsie-to-the-head/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1440,1440\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"footsie to the head\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1352\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=1440&#038;h=1440\" alt=\"footsie to the head\" width=\"1440\" height=\"1440\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg 1440w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=768&amp;h=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/footsie-to-the-head.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=1024 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1440px) 100vw, 1440px\" /></p>\n<p>In other news. the cancer charity that I had created a website for, which was then eschewed by their web person in favor of the WordPress site they were using, got back to me over the weekend.

One of the people who left was their web person, and the founder expressed again that she really wants to go with my design. We messaged a little over the weekend and I told her that I&#8217;d resume work on it this week, but that I&#8217;m also balancing the bootcamp and some other projects.</p>\n<p>So, that&#8217;s on my plate. I intend to rewrite it using React. Right now, its just HTML/LESS and a touch of JS for the menu. I also took on a project that I found I wasn&#8217;t ready for. I started creating a timesheet for my wife&#8217;s department at her job. They&#8217;re still using paper. However, I found that my lack of backend/database knowledge makes it impossible for me to complete. I thought I&#8217;d just load employee info using an array, but then I realized that the users wouldn&#8217;t be able to actually enter and save their hours, so its back-burnered for a bit. I also want to rebuild the websites that we use at work for our corporate page and for the application&#8217;s page, since I know more than Front Page and Expression Web now. I actually remade the landing page for the applications a few months ago and made it responsive. I never completed the rest of the site though. And, I want to rebuild at least part of the website for my tech support company. Right now, its entirely a WordPress site. If I can get these done, its essentially four real-world projects I can add to my portfolio. We&#8217;ll see what happens though. My main focus right now is completing those two Udemy courses.</p>\n<p>Oh, and my 7-year old has started teaching her classmates how to use Scratch. 😉 She wants me to show her HTML/CSS and teach her how to blog, and start a YouTube channel. There&#8217;s so much going on, and not enough hours in a day&#8230;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a rough few weeks, with regard to coding. React was harder than I thought it was going to be. I understand the concepts, but for some reason, I&#8217;m not able to implement it on my own very capably.

Here&#8217;s the description from his YouTube channel:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>Today, you&#8217;re going to embark on a journey into the world of Frontend Development! In doing so, you&#8217;re going to utilize HTML, CSS &amp; a tiny bit of JavaScript to create an actual website layout that works on multiple devices (yes, it&#8217;s &#8220;Responsive&#8221;!). Throughout this course, I assume you have no experience building sites or apps &#8212; BUT, this is a *Crash Course*, which means we pack a LOT of content in a relatively short amount of time. The purpose of this course is to get your feet wet and determine if Frontend development might be right for you. You will get to see the full picture of what a Frontend developer does!</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QA0XpGhiz5w?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>The site he builds is <em>responsive,</em> which means that it adjusts to accommodate different screen sizes &#8211; typically mobile (smartphone), tablet and widescreen (computer monitor). He&#8217;s also a UI/UX designer, by trade, I believe, so his work typically reflects well-thought-out visual design aesthetics and usability.</p>\n<p>(Also, although you don&#8217;t really see it in this video much, I think the bass on his wall is a Schecter Stiletto Studio-5, which I really love. The neck on those things is so smooth&#8230;)</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>For those of you who are new to web development, Gary, from DesignCourse just released a 2.25 hour crash course focusing on HTML &amp; CSS, which is the entry point for frontend web development.

I read all of the Fundamentals unit and the Research Planning section of the Discovery unit. I really want to get a better grasp of design, because I can see it playing a big role in creating web applications, as much as in static websites. I&#8217;ve also been looking at other UX resources, like the following video from <strong>DesignCourse</strong> on YouTube.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;ve mainly gathered from this particular video is a sense of partitioning sections of a page for balance purposes, wrapped in the concepts of contrast, color and scale for differentiation and hierarchy. Its considerably different from what I&#8217;ve done at work, designing front-end interfaces for our EMR, and also takes a completely different approach from what I&#8217;ve read in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Information-Dashboard-Design-At-Glance/dp/1938377001/\"><strong>Information Dashboard Design</strong></a>, by <strong>Stephen Few</strong>.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bxm89gSRUOE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Visual design and functional design seem to be different disciplines. Naturally, I&#8217;m going to have to seek out more resources on the latter, because the web resources I&#8217;ve seen so far focus on the former, and my long-term plan is to be able to create web applications, which will likely make use of dashboards for different user roles. Regardless, enjoy the video!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last week, I read through some of the Training Kit for the UX track at Lambda.

School: Full Stack – Unit 2, Sprint 5: Components I","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-kp","content":"<p>Components are reusable pieces of code, usually fulfilling a single, specific function. With regard to web applications, JavaScript doesn’t have true standalone components like other languages, but instead relies on an amalgamation of independent JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create reusable code. Components serve to help keep code DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and in other languages (or libraries and frameworks) are generally self-contained files with all necessary elements for their functionality included.</p>\n<p>In general, if there’s a process that’s being done repeatedly in a web application, or a group of elements that are repeatedly being rendered onscreen in different places, those are good candidates for conversion to a component, so they can be called as needed and not have their code duplicated throughout an application or website.</p>\n<p>The most complex JavaScript component that I’ve written for myself so far is the one that renders project details onto the page in my portfolio. Previously, all of the projects were added individually using HTML and were styled with CSS/LESS. When I refactored my portfolio to use JavaScript, I reduced the amount of repeated code significantly by creating a component (really, a function) using JavaScript that rendered an HTML block onscreen (.createElement) using a line of data from an array which had details for the given project. The component rendered the HTML, and each element included an appropriate class, where necessary, which allowed it to be styled using CSS.</p>\n<p>So, basically, each project in my portfolio, which previously needed about 8 lines of HTML code (multiplied by my current 15 projects, with an additional 5 that I need to finish and then add to the portfolio) was reduced to a single line of data in an array, which was consumed by a function that gets it rendered onscreen. Updating them is now a centralized process, with regard to code. The only time I might have to individually update projects is if I need to modify the actual data in the array for a given project – which I did when I added a project type under each project’s name.</p>\n<p>My next iteration will redo it using React, to make it a true self-contained component, instead of one which relies on external CSS for positioning and styling – and to turn it into a single-page application (SPA).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1274\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/components-i-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"components-I-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1274\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"components-I-1\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong></h3>\n<p>In the Lambda School Training Kit, creating buttons is used as an example of when to write a component. We’re given some sample code like this HTML:</p>\n<pre>&lt;div class=\"custom-buttons\"&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Button 1&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Button 2&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Button 3&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button&gt;Button 4&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>What we have here is essentially the same code (and any associated CSS) being repeated to create 4 buttons. The only difference is possibly the button’s name. It’s a good candidate for conversion into a component. To accomplish this, the first thing that’s needed, in this case, is adding custom classes to the buttons and the &lt;div&gt;, so that they can be easily styled later on.</p>\n<pre>&lt;div class=\"custom-buttons\"&gt;\n  &lt;button class=\"custom-btn\"&gt;Button 1&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button class=\"custom-btn\"&gt;Button 2&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button class=\"custom-btn\"&gt;Button 3&lt;/button&gt;\n  &lt;button class=\"custom-btn\"&gt;Button 4&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;</pre>\n<p>We’re advised to use custom classes that are specific to the elements in the component. The rationale is that if the CSS is very specific, its easy to move the component around (even to other programs) without accidentally impacting other page elements that might be the same type(s) or have similar class names.</p>\n<p>Components are also saved in their own files, instead of occupying space in a file with other code. We’re advised that if we’re using a preprocessor (like LESS) a common practice is to name the file after the component. It can then be <em>imported</em> into the main component’s file for easy usage, like so:</p>\n<pre>@import custom-btn.less</pre>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1275\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/components-i-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"components-I-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1275\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"components-I-2\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/components-i-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /></h3>\n<h3><strong>JavaScript</strong></h3>\n<p>In a component, JavaScript consumes data and outputs content to the DOM, generally via a function. Component functions make use of methods such as .createElement, .textContent, .classList, .appendChild and .addEventListener to attach HTML elements to nodes on the DOM and make them interactive. For example, the HTML buttons above could be created via a JS component like this:</p>\n<pre>let button = document.createElement('button');\nbutton.textContent = 'Button 1';\nbutton.classList.add('button');\nbutton.addEventListener('click', (e) =&gt; {\n    console.log('clicked!');\n});\nparent.appendChild(button);</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>.createElement</strong> creates a new HTML element and stores it in memory. It can later be placed on the DOM.</li>\n<li><strong>.textContent</strong> places (or displays) specific text in an element.</li>\n<li><strong>.classList</strong> is used to add or remove a class from an element. This can dynamically alter an element’s appearance, or even control whether or not it appears onscreen at all.</li>\n<li><strong>.appendChild</strong> attaches a new HTML element to the end of an existing element onscreen.</li>\n<li><strong>.prepend</strong> is a companion method that places a new HTML element before the specified element.</li>\n<li><strong>.addEventListener,</strong> of course, lets elements respond to user interactions, allowing input from devices, such as mouse clicks, keypresses, hover effects and more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, in the above example, a new button element is created. Its given the name “Button 1”. The “button” class is added to it, and an event listener is added that will console.log the word “clicked!” when the button is clicked. Finally, the button is added to the page, appended below an existing button, already onscreen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1276\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/2019-09-04-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.04 01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1276\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.04 01\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-01.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h3><strong>Functions</strong></h3>\n<p>Now that we see how JavaScript can be used to create an HTML button, and place it onscreen, the above function can be modified more to make it a true function, which is reusable, DRY and can even accept input to name each button something unique:</p>\n<pre>//button creator component\nfunction buttonCreator(buttonText){\n    const button = document.createElement('button');\n    button.textContent = buttonText;\n    button.classList.add('button');\n    button.addEventListener('click', (e) =&gt; {\n        console.log('clicked!');\n    });\n    return button;\n}\n\n//create two buttons and place them onscreen\nlet firstButton = buttonCreator('Button 1');\nlet secondButton = buttonCreator('Button 2');\nparent.appendChild(firstButton);\nparent.appendChild(secondButton);</pre>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1277\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/2019-09-04-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.04 02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1277\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.04 02\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-02.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></h3>\n<h3><strong>Creating components from data</strong></h3>\n<p>At times, we will need to create components from data in an array or other object or data source (like an API). As mentioned above, my upgraded portfolio uses data from an array to render projects onscreen. An example with two lines of data from it (the cancer charity website and a Star Wars project for Lambda) looks like this:</p>\n<pre>const featuredProjects = [\n    {img: \"img/breast-cancer-comfort.jpg\", name: \"Breast Cancer Comfort\", type: \"Client Website\", visit: \"https://breast-cancer-comfort.netlify.com/\", view: \"https://github.com/vishalicious213/bcc\", desc: \"Breast cancer charity in Long Island, NY. Formerly WordPress site. Built webpage with HTML/CSS/LESS. Navigation bar written with JavaScript.\", stack: [\"js\", \"html\", \"css\", \"less\"]},\n    {img: \"img/react-wars.jpg\", name: \"React Wars\", type: \"Sprint Challenge V: React\", visit: \"https://vish213-reactwars.netlify.com\", view: \"https://github.com/vishalicious213/6.5-Sprint-Challenge-React-Wars\", desc: \"Used axios to access the Star Wars API, then used React components, state and side effects to render information about Star Wars characters. Imported and rendered images separately.\", stack: [\"js\", \"react\", \"axios\"]},\n]</pre>\n<p>Previously, all of the data (above) for each project was its own block of HTML and all of them reused the same CSS. Now, its essentially a single line of data (an object) inside of an array of objects.</p>\n<p>We can feed data from an array into the buttonCreator function from above to programmatically create as many buttons as we need for a web page. For example, given the array:</p>\n<pre>const data = [\n    \"Button One\",\n    \"Button Two\",\n    \"Button Three\",\n    \"Button Four\"\n]</pre>\n<p>We can use .forEach or .map to loop through each item in our array and pass the data to a callback function. .forEach will create each element and immediately add it to the DOM:</p>\n<pre>data.forEach((arrayItem) =&gt; {\n  let newButton = buttonCreator(arrayItem);\n  parent.appendChild(newButton);\n});</pre>\n<p>.map returns a new array, based on the output from our callback function. We can then use the array as needed:</p>\n<pre>let newComponents = data.map((arrayItem) =&gt; {\n  let newButton = buttonCreator(arrayItem);\n  // Remember, we always need to return something when we use .map\n  return newButton;\n});</pre>\n<p>Once we have the array, It can be manipulated further, or added to the DOM with .forEach, like this:</p>\n<pre>newComponents.forEach(component =&gt; {\n  parent.appendChild(component);\n});\n</pre>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1278\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/29/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-components-i/2019-09-04-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.04 04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1278\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.04 04\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/2019.09.04-04.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Components are reusable pieces of code, usually fulfilling a single, specific function.
