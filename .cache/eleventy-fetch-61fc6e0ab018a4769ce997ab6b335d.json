Altogether, it covered 9 topics over 23 lessons. The beginning topics introduced HTML and CSS, but the majority of the pre-course concerned JavaScript.</p>\n<h3>More Array Methods</h3>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We already know about and use array methods, .push, .pop, .shift, .unshift, and .length. But there are a lot more methods available to us natively on an array. The methods we are going to talk about here are called higher order methods, because they take callbacks as arguments.</em></p>\n<p>&#8220;Higher order <em>methods,&#8221;</em> as introduced above, seem to be referred to as &#8220;higher order <em>functions&#8221;</em> by the rest of the internet. I&#8217;m not sure if there&#8217;s a meaningful difference in terminology, but the definition seems to remain the same:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>One of the characteristics of JavaScript that makes it well-suited for functional programming is the fact that it can accept higher-order functions. A higher-order function is a function that can take another function as an argument, or that returns a function as a result. (<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/higher-order-functions-javascript/\">sitepoint.com</a>)</em></p>\n<p>This paragraph also seems key in understanding how callbacks are used in JavaScript:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>If you’ve done much web-based JavaScript programming or front-end development, you’ve probably come across functions that use a callback. A callback is a function that gets executed at the end of an operation, once all of the other operations of been completed. Usually this callback function is passed in as the last argument in the function. Frequently, it’s defined inline as an anonymous function. (<a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/higher-order-functions-javascript/\">sitepoint.com</a>)</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/higher-order-functions-javascript/\">sitepoint.com: Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-75461803bad\">Medium: Understanding Higher-Order Functions in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/05_higher_order.html\">Eloquent JavaScript: Higher-Order Functions</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/humans-create-software/a-dirt-simple-introduction-to-higher-order-functions-in-javascript-b33bf9e19056\">Medium: A dirt simple introduction to higher order functions in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>.forEach</h4>\n<p><strong>.forEach</strong> is a higher-order function that&#8217;s built into arrays in JavaScript. It allows an action to be looped once over every item in an array (so, it <em>iterates</em> over every item in the array).</p>\n<p>A very simple example of how to use it could look like this:</p>\n<pre>someArray.forEach(someFunction);</pre>\n<p>Since .forEach is built into every array (aka: its an array <em>method),</em> it can be called using dot notation and the array&#8217;s name. Then, in the above example, its calls another function to be iterated on each item in the given array.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>.forEach is a built in for loop on every array. .forEach takes a callback as its only argument, and iterates over every item in the array and calls the callback on it. The callback can take two arguments, the first is the item itself, the second is the index of the item, this argument is optional.</em></p>\n<pre>const cars = [‘Ford’, ‘Chevrolet’, ‘Toyota’, ‘Tesla’];</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We can write the callback function itself in the parentheses as an anonymous function</em></p>\n<pre>cars.forEach(function(item, index) {\n  console.log(item);\n});</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Or we can instantiate a function to be used as a callback.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Also, we do not need to use the index argument, if you don’t need it, feel free to leave it out.</em></p>\n<pre>function printNames(item) {\n  console.log(item);\n}</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>And call that function in the forEach parentheses</em></p>\n<pre>cars.forEach(printNames);</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@abustamam/for-loops-vs-foreach-in-javascript-7a977278a39e\">Medium: For loops vs forEach in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://gomakethings.com/es6-foreach-loops-with-vanilla-javascript/\">Go Make Things: ES6 forEach() loops with vanilla JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dmitripavlutin.com/foreach-iterate-array-javascript/\">Dmitri Pavlutin: How to Use forEach() to Iterate an Array in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>.map</h4>\n<p>The <strong>.map</strong> array method calls a specified callback function once for each element in an array.

It does not run on array elements (1) with indexes that have never been set, (2) which have been deleted or (3) which were never assigned a value.

Its something like a glorified version of passing a variable to a function so that its value can be used in the function its being sent to.</p>\n<p>Common convention uses the word <strong>&#8220;callback&#8221;</strong> or the letters <strong>&#8220;cb&#8221;</strong> as the variable for the function being used as a variable in another function. Its not set-in-stone, but its essentially a best practice.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>A very important concept in Javascript is the ability to pass a function as an arguments to another function. These functions are called callbacks. These functions can be called anytime and passed arguments within the function. We will soon discover why callbacks are so important to Javascript. Convention is to use the callback or cb argument variable as your callback, although as always you are free to name them what you please.</em></p>\n<pre>function saysHelloToUser(user) {\n  return ‘Hello ’ + user + ‘!’;\n}\n\nfunction saysGoodbyeToUser(user) {\n  return 'Goodbye ' + user + '!';\n}\n\nfunction createGreeting(user, cb) {\n  return cb(user);\n}\n\ncreateGreeting('Dan', saysHelloToUser); // 'Hello Dan!'\ncreateGreeting('Dan', saysGoodbyeToUser); // 'Goodbye Dan!'</pre>\n<p>Looking at the code above, we can see that three functions have been declared. One says &#8220;hello&#8221; to a person, one says &#8220;goodbye&#8221; to a person, and the third looks for a person&#8217;s name and initiates a callback.</p>\n<p>The two lines of code at the bottom use the third function to call the first function that says &#8220;hello&#8221; and passes a person&#8217;s name to it. That &#8220;hello&#8221; function then returns the person&#8217;s name and a string as output.</p>\n<p>The  last line of code does the same thing, but uses the second function to say &#8220;goodbye&#8221; instead of hello. Although these functions simple, its evident that much more complex functions can be used instead, and their output can be used as data to power other functions via callbacks.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s the explanation for that same code, from the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Within createGreeting we have set the parameter cb to equal whatever was passed in as the second argument. In the above example we see that in the first createGreeting call, the function saysHelloToUser was passed as the second argument. This gives us the ability to call cb (which is equal to the function saysHelloToUser) within the createGreeting function.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqAJ0az3j6U?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

Its major use is to allow methods to be created and attached to the prototype so that all objects that a function creates automatically has access to those methods. Basically, instead of having to create separate methods in their own object and have other objects call them, methods can inherently be included in any instance of an object created by a function &#8211; this saves space in computer memory and lines of code.</p>\n<p>So, to reiterate: a prototype is a property that every function in JavaScript has. When a function is created, it automatically gets a prototype. It allows methods to be shared across all instances of a given function &#8211; so any method created and attached to a given function&#8217;s prototype will be available to any object that the function creates.</p>\n<p>What does this look like? The general idea is something like this:</p>\n<pre>function gameCharacter (name) {\n  let gameCharacter = Object.create(gameCharacter.prototype)\n  gameCharacter.name = name\n\n  return gameCharacter\n}\n\ngameCharacter.prototype.run = function (distance, speed) {\n  console.log(`${this.name} is running.`)\n}\n\ngameCharacter.prototype.jump = function (height, jumpMultiplier) {\n  console.log(`${this.name} jumps.`)\n}\n\ngameCharacter.prototype.duck = function (duration) {\n  console.log(`${this.name} ducks.`)\n}\n\nconst mario = gameCharacter('mario');\nconst luigi = gameCharacter('luigi');\nconst sonic = gameCharacter('sonic');\n\nmario.run(whileLeftOrRightButtonPressed, 5);\nluigi.play(whileJumpButtonPressed, 1.5);\nsonic.duck(whileDownButtonPressed);\nsonic.run(whileLeftOrRightButtonPressed, 10);</pre>\n<p>So, whether we create Mario, Luigi or Sonic, they all gain the abilities to run, jump and duck. Any &#8220;gameCharacter&#8221; we create will have those abilities, so we can add Princess Peach or Amy the Hedgehog or even Chun Li and they&#8217;d also have those abilities.</p>\n<p>This video from Tyler McGinnis beautifully explains prototypes by showing how functions and objects are created and then evolving it into prototypes:</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XskMWBXNbp0?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Creating functions are expensive (in a computer memory way) and each time we create a new class object with methods we are recreating those methods in memory. You can imagine if you are creating thousands of class objects from a class with dozens of methods on it, the memory will add up quickly (20,000-40,000 methods). Classes have a unique way of setting a method once and giving every object of that class access to those methods. This is called the prototype. Each class has a prototype property, which we can then set methods on:</em></p>\n<pre>function User(name, github) {\n  this.name = name;\n  this.github = github;\n}\n\nUser.prototype.introduction = function(){\n  return 'My name is ' + this.name + ', my github handle is ' + this.github + '.';\n}\n\nlet dan = new User('Dan', 'tetondan');\nlet riley = new User('Riley', 'rileyriley');\nconsole.log(dan.introduction()); // My name is Dan, my github handle is tetondan.\nconsole.log(riley.introduction()); // My name is Riley, my github handle is rileyriley.</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Prototype methods DO have access to the <strong>this</strong> keyword, and just as before, it will always point to the object (left of the dot) that is calling it.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/better-programming/prototypes-in-javascript-5bba2990e04b\">Medium: Prototypes in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://tylermcginnis.com/beginners-guide-to-javascript-prototype/\">tylermcginnis.com: A Beginner&#8217;s Guide to JavaScript&#8217;s Prototype</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Djp_kwnc428?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

From reading on the internet, I&#8217;ve learned that classes don&#8217;t offer any new functionality beyond what objects and object prototypes already do; what they do is provide a cleaner way to write objects or functions. Their syntax makes it easier for programmers who are versed in other languages to move to JavaScript, since its more straightforward than older methods of working with objects prior to ES6, the big JavaScript/ECMAScript update from 2015.</p>\n<p>This is an example of creating a <em>function</em> in JavaScript. Its composed of the keyword function, the name of the function, opening and closing parenthesis, and opening and closing brackets:</p>\n<pre>function screamsInJS() {}</pre>\n<p>This is an example of creating a <em>class</em> in JavaScript. Its basically the same as creating a function, but without the parenthesis (class keyword, class name, brackets):</p>\n<pre> class zodiacSign {}</pre>\n<p>These two fantastic articles by <strong><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/users/taniarascia\">Tania Rascia</a></strong> and <a href=\"https://www.majidkorai.com/\"><strong>Majid Hussain</strong></a>, respectively, provide a clear description of JavaScript classes and insight into how classes differ from functions and prototypes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-classes-in-javascript\">Digital Ocean: Understanding Classes in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/tech-tajawal/javascript-classes-under-the-hood-6b26d2667677\">Medium: JavaScript Classes &#8211; Under the Hood</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Often times when we create an object, we are creating a template. Rather than copy that template over and over again, Javascript gives us access to what we call a constructor or class. Classes share much of the same functionality as regular objects, but also expands on that functionality greatly. Classes are useful for creating many objects that share some of the same properties and methods (such as users on a website).</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes\">Mozilla Developer Network: Classes</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://raganwald.com/2015/05/11/javascript-classes.html\">raganwald.com: OOP, JavaScript, and so-called Classes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Class and Pseudo Classical Instantiation</h4>\n<p>I can understand how to use classes in JavaScript on a very basic level. What makes my head spin is trying to comprehend how its different from other programming languages. I don&#8217;t quite grasp the difference yet, but apparently, JavaScript&#8217;s implementation of classes is not the same as classes in other object-oriented programming languages, like Java and C++. The little I was able to get makes them seem the same to me &#8211; in both cases, classes are blueprints or templates for creating objects, and there&#8217;s something to do with inheritance, which is some kind of passing down of permissions or states to an object from whatever created it. Maybe later on in the full Lambda course, it&#8217;ll become clearer.</p>\n<p>The following article makes a case for using objects or functions in place of classes in JavaScript. Its an interesting read, as it discusses the differences and similarities between each of those items:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@vapurrmaid/should-you-use-classes-in-javascript-82f3b3df6195\">Medium: Should You Use Classes in JavaScript?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>From the Medium article:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>A class is a blueprint for creating objects. We define what properties and methods an object should have, which taken together are considered a type, and then instantiate many objects using that blueprint. Perhaps a more visual analogy is that a class acts as an <strong>object creation factory</strong>.</em></p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>If you have experience in an Object Oriented language (such as Java or C#) you are probably familiar with the concept of classes. While Javascript does not provide a ‘true’ class system, there is something very familiar. For the sake of argument we will call our class objects ‘classes’. It is instantiated in a Pseudo Classical way, using the new keyword, and can take arguments.</em></p>\n<p>The above text from Lambda also makes the claim that JavaScript&#8217;s implementation of classes isn&#8217;t a true class system, compared to other object-oriented programming languages. It, too, doesn&#8217;t really explain why.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a thread from Reddit that discusses class in JavaScript and compares it to other languages&#8217; implementations without using terminology or concepts that I can follow yet. It does look like common parlance will refer to classes in JavaScript as classes, however, and computer scientists will refer to them as something else, like maybe a class object or ES6 class:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/30lu4r/class_class_object_constructor_function/\">Reddit: Class? Class object? Constructor function?</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In this example we will be creating a Cat class. Convention for classes is to give the name of anything that can be instantiated with the new keyword an uppercase name. When we use the new keyword, Javascript does some great behind the scenes work for us and creates and returns an object automatically.</em></p>\n<p>I think that the &#8220;great behind the scenes work&#8221; that the above text refers to is using a constructor to build an object or class. I&#8217;m a little unclear about what that all entails, but most of the websites that I&#8217;ve read which discuss classes in JavaScript give examples that make use of a constructor inside of the class to create objects. It seems that if a constructor is left out, JavaScript automatically adds an invisible one with no parameters to the class. Once I find out more about this, I&#8217;ll post.</p>\n<pre>function Cat(name) {\n  // the 'new' operator creates an object, ‘this’\n  this.name = name;\n\n  this.meows = function() {\n    return ‘My name is ’ + this.name + ’ …Meow!’;\n  }\n\n  // return the object ‘this’\n}\n\nconst sam = new Cat('Sam');\nconst kitty = new Cat('Kitty');\n\nconsole.log(sam.meows()); // 'My name is Sam ...Meow!'\nconsole.log(kitty.meows()); // 'My name is Kitty ...Meow!'</pre>\n<h4>&#8216;this&#8217; in Classes</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The this keyword can start to become very confusing when we start using it in classes. In the last example we use it in the meows method. A good rule of thumb if you are not certain what this is referring to, is to look at where the method is called, and the object to the left of the ‘dot’. That is the object this refers to.</em></p>\n<p>So far, &#8220;this&#8221; hasn&#8217;t been a problem for me to use. I&#8217;ve only used it inside of a method or class, but it seems fairly straightforward at this stage that it simply refers to the object that its used inside of. I understand that it gets more complicated later on, but we&#8217;ll cross that bridge when we get there.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zj8lV5j0DEE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda School</a></strong>. Information about how to join was shared on <strong><a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a>,</strong> and we used <strong><a href=\"https://zoom.us/\">Zoom</a></strong> to actually meet. Zoom is going to be our main classroom, in this brave, new virtual world. I&#8217;m new to both of these programs. I&#8217;ve been using Slack for a few weeks, because of Lambda, and yesterday was my first experience with Zoom as well. I like both technologies, although I think I prefer <strong><a href=\"https://discordapp.com/\">Discord</a></strong> to Slack right now. We&#8217;ll see how that looks in a year.</p>\n<p>The Zoom session was hosted by <strong>Jazmyne Muhammmad</strong>, who I think was out in Las Vegas, and lasted about an hour. It was very informative and definitely worked to humanize the onboarding process. There are six different tracks starting on Monday, including my full-time full-stack one. That one is actually unusually large. All of the other tracks have a team lead, but ours has two of them due to size. There&#8217;s a pool of 300 team leads though, so we won&#8217;t be without support. They&#8217;re all former students, so they should know the experience that new students are going through pretty intimately.</p>\n<p>The session went over a lot of the nuts-and-bolts about how classes are structured, about the Income Share Agreement and other technical details. It also went into softer matters that are equally important, like how to act in class (especially web etiquette, since this is an online class) and what&#8217;s expected of us, socially, both in class and later on, on the job.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zflW3FbD0KI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>I found <strong><a href=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/orientation.jpg\">myself</a></strong>, at the start of the video!</p>\n<p>So, for the past hour or so (yeah, I&#8217;ve been getting up at 4 AM on most days for the past few weeks. Its when I write a lot of this stuff) I was reading through different channels on Slack. There was a list of suggested channels that another student put together, and I looked at them &#8211; there are even more channels for so many topics. There&#8217;s even one for Lambda students who write blogs about the school. It has zero content right now, so I&#8217;m going to ask and see if anyone else has been blogging their experience and see if I can get some activity going on it, along with sharing this stuff there.</p>\n<p>One of the channels was <strong>family_support</strong>, and its both heartening and heart-breaking to see people&#8217;s families and whose lives they&#8217;re trying to better, along with reading about some of the horrible situations people are trying to escape through education. I can relate to the new parent posts and the people trying to balance being present for their kids while making it through the class, but my heart really goes out to the people just trying to <em>escape.</em></p>\n<p>I read about people running from domestic violence &#8211; a lot of it was from parents. There&#8217;s a person whose wife and kid left him, because they don&#8217;t have the patience to help see this through with him. There&#8217;s a couple raising an autistic kid and worrying about not being there when he has episodes and needs comfort and reassurance. There are people who lost their lives and were homeless, who are, even now, barely scraping by. There&#8217;s a person who moved from Tibet to find a better life in the US and hasn&#8217;t seen his wife and baby in three years &#8211; and she was just 3 months old when he left! There are homeschooling parents and single parents and first-time parents going through their babies&#8217; teething for the first time.</p>\n<p>One mother shared this video, which she used to explain to her young kids what she was doing at Lambda. I&#8217;m going to show it to mine (it&#8217;ll be a nice change from CookieSwirlC and MasterOv, and CocoMelon&#8230; I know dozens of Peppa Pig episodes by heart!):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GyGdhSUEOjs?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>So, anyway, I never completed college. I&#8217;m self-taught with just about everything I know, but I&#8217;ve come to realize that I can&#8217;t learn programming by myself at a fast enough pace to transition careers from I/T to development, which is why I&#8217;m going to work through Lambda. Jazmyne said, repeatedly, that its going to be really hard, and I believe her. It looks like there&#8217;s a decent support network available though&#8230; and at least one person on the Slack said that she read someone else who completed their track and advised, &#8220;There are going to be times when you want to quit. Don&#8217;t.&#8221; I know there&#8217;s light at the end of the tunnel, and I&#8217;m only just getting on the train, so this is going to be an experience.</p>\n<p>It looks like the earliest that my track can be completed is May 29th, but people can and will complete it later, because if there are concepts that we don&#8217;t grasp well, we can move to later cohorts and retake parts of the class. Hopefully, this doesn&#8217;t end up being a year-long saga for me, but I don&#8217;t know if, at my age, I&#8217;ll run the marathon in the same time as I might have 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>Oh, and I need to finish 4 more blog posts about the pre-course to close out the entire thing. I&#8217;m going to try and do that before the end of the weekend. I imagine that my posting will dramatically decrease once classes start.</p>\n<p>Onward and upward!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, yesterday was orientation for Lambda School.

It can be a function. Functions saved in an object are called methods, just like baked-in methods such as .length, .push and .pop.</p>\n<p>A key (variable) can be declared in an object and its value can be set to a function. So, whatever value is in the function, or whatever value it reduces down to once its run, becomes the key&#8217;s value.</p>\n<p>Methods are called using dot notation and trailing parenthesis and can include arguments, like any other function.</p>\n<pre>const newObject = {\n  sayHiMethod: function() {\n    console.log(‘Hi Everyone!’);\n  },\n}\n\nnewObject.sayHiMethod(); // Hi Everyone!</pre>\n<h3>for…in Loops</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/definition/3821/iteration\"><strong>Iteration</strong></a> is essentially the process of looping until a condition is met that ends the loop.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Sometimes we want to iterate over each key:value pair in our object. With arrays we used a standard for loop and an index number variable. Objects do not contain numerical indexes so the standard loop will not work for objects. Javascript has a second type of for loop built in called the “for…in” loop. It is slightly different syntax, it starts the same but in the parentheses we will declare a variable, the keyword in, and the name of the object. This will loop over each key in the object and finish when all of the keys have been iterated over. We can use this key, and bracket notation, in our for loop to access the value associated with that key.</em></p>\n<p>A &#8220;for/in&#8221; statement loops through each of the properties of an object. It runs a specified block of code from inside the loop once for each property. It does not follow a set order for each iteration &#8211; it essentially visits each key randomly until that iteration is complete, so its advised not to add or remove keys from an object using a for/in loop.</p>\n<p>Apparently, the most practical use for the loop is to display the value of each key in an object for debugging purposes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_forin.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript for/in Statement</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...in\">Mozilla Developer Network: for&#8230;in</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<pre>const user = {\n  username: ‘dan.frehner’,\n  password: ‘abc123’,\n  lovesJavascript: true,\n  favoriteNumber: 42,\n};\n\nfor (let key in user){\n  console.log(key);\n  console.log(user[key]);\n}\n\n// username\n// 'dan.frehner'\n// password\n// 'abc123'\n// lovesJavascript\n// true\n// favoriteNumber\n// 42</pre>\n<h3><span style=\"font-family:Monaco, Consolas, 'Andale Mono', 'DejaVu Sans Mono', 'Courier 10 Pitch', Courier, monospace;color:var(--color-text);\">The ‘this’ Keyword</span></h3>\n<p>The <strong>this</strong> keyword refers to the object that it belongs to. Its basically a keyword that points to the object that owns it, mainly to simplify typing and coding. It makes code a little more readable, because when inside of an object, instead of essentially having type something like objectName.keyName, a programmer can use this.keyName to refer to a key inside of an object. Think of it like saying his/her instead of using a formal name when referring to someone in a group.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp\">w3schools: The JavaScript this Keyword</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this\">Mozilla Developer Network: this</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/\">JavaScript is Sexy: Understand JavaScript’s “this” With Clarity, and Master It</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Objects have a self referential keyword that may be applied in each object called this. When called inside of an object it is referring to that very object. this can be used to access other keys in the same object, and is especially useful in methods:</em></p>\n<pre>const user = {\n  username: ‘dan.frehner’,\n  password: ‘abc123’,\n  lovesJavascript: true,\n  favoriteNumber: 42,\n\n  userSaysHi: function(){\n    console.log( this.username + ’ says hi!’);\n  },\n};\n\nuser.usersaysHi(); // 'dan.frehner says hi!'</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Note: the this keyword can sometimes be one of the more difficult topics in Javascript. We are using it very basically here, but the topic gets much more complex very soon.</em></p>\n<h3>Objects in Javascript</h3>\n<p>tl;dr: Everything in JavaScript is an object!</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In this lesson we learned what Objects are and the many ways to access values, call methods, and assign values. Many of these techniques looked very familiar, as if we had used them in virtually every aspect of our learnings so far. There is a pattern here, that is because EVERYTHING in Javascript is an Object. Arrays are just objects with numerical keys, Strings are objects under the hood with built in methods, functions are actually objects with their own special properties, the entire Javascript runtime is an object (window in a browser, or global in Node.js). The more you work with Javascript the more this will start to make sense to you. Just remember, everything is an object.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNfaU-bVdqM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

Primitive data types hold one piece of data &#8211; like a string, number or boolean variable. Objects, like arrays, hold a set of data. They&#8217;re often contrasted with arrays by explaining that arrays generally contain data about <em>multiple, distinct items</em> &#8211; like an array with a collection of the names of car manufacturers or bands or people. Objects also hold a collection of data, but they&#8217;re generally about <em>a single thing</em>; like a person&#8217;s height, weight, eye color, skin color and hair color. Arrays basically have information about a collection of items, and objects have more detailed data about one particular item.</p>\n<p>Objects are declared like variables, but using braces at the ends ( <strong>{}</strong> ), somewhat like a function.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In the last lesson we introduced Arrays. Arrays are containers that hold collections of data. In this lesson we will introduce another data container, the Object. Objects and arrays are similar in some ways and very different in others. Where arrays hold multiple items related to each other, Objects will hold a lot of information about one thing. Objects are instantiated by using braces ({}).</em></p>\n<pre>const newObj = {};</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects\">Mozilla Developer Network: Working with objects</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Key:Value pairs</h4>\n<p><strong>Keys</strong> are essentially variables that exist in an object. <strong>Values</strong> are the data that goes into the key. For example, if there was an object called <em>band</em> and its keys included <em>bandName,</em> <em>guitarist, bassist, drummer</em> and <em>vocalist,</em> then we could conceivably have an object with the following key:value pairs:</p>\n<pre>const band = {\n  bandName: 'Godflesh',\n  guitarist: 'Justin Broadrick',\n  bassist: 'G.C. Green',\n  drummer: 'drum machine',\n  vocalist: 'Justin Broadrick',\n};</pre>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Unlike arrays that have index valued items, objects use a concept called key:value pairs. The key is the identifier and the value is the value we want to save to that key. The syntax is “key: value”. Objects can hold many key:value pairs, they must be separated by a comma (no semi-colons inside of an object!). Keys are unique in an object, there can be only one key of that name. Although, multiple keys can have the same value. Values can be any Javascript type, string, number, boolean, array, function or even another object. In this demo we will create a user object.</em></p>\n<pre>const user = {\n  username: 'dan.frehner',\n  password: 'abc123',\n  lovesJavascript: true,\n  favoriteNumber: 42,\n};</pre>\n<h4>Accessing Values</h4>\n<p>The values in key:value pairs can be accessed by calling the object name and the key. There are two ways to do this: <strong>dot notation</strong> and <strong>bracket notation</strong>.</p>\n<p>To get a value using dot notation, we call the object name, a dot and the key name:</p>\n<pre>band.bassist; // G.C. Green\nband.drummer; // drum machine</pre>\n<p>This is the same process as calling the .length property on an array because, apparently the .length property is also a key:value pair!</p>\n<p>Getting a value using bracket notation is like calling an item in an array, although we must use a string or number to specify which item, or a variable that points to a string or number. Keys are wrapped in quotation marks when calling them.</p>\n<pre>const passString = 'password';\nuser['lovesJavascript']; // true\nuser['username']; // dan.frehner\nuser[passString]; // abc123</pre>\n<p>The above example uses data from the <em>user</em> object from the Lambda School text. Note that passString and user[passString] are not the same variable, even though their names are similar. passString is a global variable, and user[passString] refers to a key inside of the user object. Hence, their values are different (&#8216;password&#8217; and &#8216;abc123&#8217;, respectively&#8230; neither of which are secure passwords).</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In the wild you will see brackets almost always being used with variables.</em></p>\n<h4>Assigning Values</h4>\n<p>Assigning values works just like accessing them. We can assign them, with dot notation, or with bracket notation when the object is created (just like declaring a variable):</p>\n<pre>const newUser = {isNew: true,}\nconst loveJSString = 'lovesJavascript';\n\nnewUser.username = 'new.username';\nnewUser['password'] = '12345';\nnewUser[loveJSString] = true;</pre>\n<p>In the above example from the Lambda School text, the object <em>newUser</em> is created with a single key:value pair called <em>isNew,</em> which is assigned the value of <em>true. </em>Then a global variable called loveJSString is created. Next, three new key:value pairs are created and added to the newUser object: newUser.username, newUser.password and newUser.loveJSString. Values are assigned to each of the keys.</p>\n<p>Note that the three new key:value pairs are assigned using a different format. The first one is assigned using dot notation. The second uses bracket notation with quotation marks, and the last uses bracket notation without quotation marks. All are valid. From what I&#8217;ve read outside of the pre-course, quotes are required if a key&#8217;s name begins with a number instead of a letter.</p>\n<h4>Removing Properties</h4>\n<p>A property can be removed from an object using the <strong>delete</strong> keyword. My understanding of this is that <em>property</em> refers to a key in an object, and that deleting it removes it entirely from the object, so that it, and its value, are no longer part of the object. Its like if, using the Lambda School newUser object in the previous example, newUser simply stopped tracking something like the loveJSString key for all newUsers.</p>\n<p>If a property is deleted from an object, any attempt to call that property and get a value for it will return &#8220;undefined&#8221;.</p>\n<pre>const newObject = {removeThisProperty: true,};\n\ndelete newObject.removeThisProperty;</pre>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>It is rare we will see the use of the delete keyword, many find best practice to be setting the value of a keyword to undefined.

Allred</strong>, the CEO and founder of <a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\"><strong>Lambda School</strong></a> just wrote an op-end for <strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/\">Wired</a></strong> regarding student debt and the emergence of non-traditional schools that offer an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_share_agreement\"><strong>ISA option</strong></a> over the traditional method of paying for college or secondary education.</p>\n<p>Overall, I agree with his stance, hence my enrollment at Lambda School. I think that the US education system has a lot of room for improvement, particularly with regard to enabling students from all backgrounds (read: income brackets) to learn useful skills to support themselves in adulthood and be productive members of society.</p>\n<p>Its no secret that people with greater means are able to more easily afford to pay for higher education and better position themselves financially in life. Those who come from lesser means often struggle to acquire the same quality of education or have to make do without it altogether. Ultimately, this removes talent and innovation from our country&#8217;s workforce and reduces our global potential.</p>\n<p>I like the idea that ISA agreements turn the traditional process of paying for school and then hoping to do well and land a good job on its head. In the US, schools, right now, are a loaded business that are not balanced in favor of students. They essentially exist to generate income for their institutions, much like the healthcare industry (which I currently work for and have done for the past 20ish years) or insurance industry or pharmaceutical industry. Its a disservice to its patrons.</p>\n<p>Schools like Lambda take a different approach, akin to the secondary education system in Australia, according to another blogger who I follow (<a href=\"https://mydevquest.wordpress.com/2019/07/15/lack-of-progress/#comment-24\">see the July 18th comment from Rebecca, here</a>). Theoretically, their investment is in the students themselves, allocating resources to educate them and then helping with job placement &#8211; because <em>they only get paid if the students, themselves, are successful</em>. This is, in my mind, a daring setup. Where traditional schools collect money and leave students to sink-or-swim, this new class of schools guides students and takes steps to help ensure that their investment in the student is not wasted.</p>\n<p>As someone who did not complete college, more than 20 years ago, due to frustration with the setup of the system, I wish something like this was available when I graduated high school. I hope it does well and innovates the current system, along with free education resources, because <a href=\"https://www.monticello.org/site/research-and-collections/educated-citizenry-vital-requisite-our-survival-free-people-spurious\">an educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/to-end-student-debt-tie-tuition-to-post-grad-salaries/\">To End Student Debt, Tie Tuition to Post-Graduation Salaries</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Austen Allred, the CEO and founder of Lambda School just wrote an op-end for Wired regarding student debt and the emergence of non-traditional schools that offer an ISA option over the traditional method of paying for college or secondary education.

I&#8217;ve been unable to find a lot of information about array properties. From what I can see, there are not many of them. The ones I&#8217;ve come across so far are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>constructor:</strong> returns a reference to the array function that created the object</li>\n<li><strong>index:</strong> represents the zero-based index of the match in the string</li>\n<li><strong>input:</strong> only present in arrays created by regular expression matches</li>\n<li><strong>length:</strong> reflects the number of elements in an array (dynamically updates)</li>\n<li><strong>prototype:</strong> allows addition of properties and methods to an object</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don&#8217;t quite grasp the usefulness of the <strong>constructor</strong> property yet. It seems like it just gives the name of the function that called it. <strong>Index</strong> is just the number of the given item in an array (since counting starts at zero, the actual position is one less than how we normally count when starting at one). <strong>Input</strong> basically confirms that a string or some other value is present in a given array. <strong>Length</strong> counts the number of items in an array and automatically updates if the array grows or shrinks. Finally <strong>prototype</strong> lets a programmer create a new property or method. This property or method can then be used with any array in a given program, so its kind of like writing a new function that can be used on all of the arrays in a program.</p>\n<p>Like functions, arrays have their own <a href=\"https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-reference/javascript-array-object.php\"><strong>built-in methods</strong></a>. Some of the following pages were shared in the last post, but they bear repeating as they detail many methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Array Methods</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://javascript.info/array-methods\">JavaScript.info: Array Methods</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://dev.to/frugencefidel/10-javascript-array-methods-you-should-know-4lk3\">dev.to: 10 JavaScript array methods you should know</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.tutorialspoint.com/javascript/javascript_arrays_object\">tutorialspoint: JavaScript &#8211; The Arrays Object</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Array methods covered in the pre-course</h3>\n<p>A word of advice to students taking the pre-course and readying for the challenge at the end: go over array methods, and learn more about sorting methods, in particular. When I took the challenge, the questions that gave me the most difficulty all had to do with sorting arrays and inserting data into them at points that were NOT the beginning or end. These concepts are not covered in the pre-course, and I think are included to force potential students to learn on the spot and to use the internet to quickly find information to help pass the challenge.</p>\n<h4>.length</h4>\n<p>The <strong>.length</strong> method returns the number of items in an array:</p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, ‘Raj’];\n\nconsole.log(studentNames.length); // 4</pre>\n<h4>.push &amp; .pop</h4>\n<p>These methods add items to an array and remove items from an array after it’s initial declaration, respectively.</p>\n<p><strong>.push</strong> adds an item to the <em>end</em> of the array, incrementing it’s length by 1. (.push returns the new length)</p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, ‘Raj’];\n\nstudentNames.push('Ryan');\n\nconsole.log(studentNames); // ['Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'Raj', 'Ryan']</pre>\n<p><strong>.pop</strong> removes the <em>last</em> item in the array, decrementing the length by 1. (.pop returns the “popped” item)</p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, ‘Raj’];\n\nstudentNames.pop();\n\nconsole.log(studentNames); // ['Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara']</pre>\n<h4>.unshift &amp; .shift</h4>\n<p>.unshift and .shift are exactly like .push and .pop, except they operate on the <em>first item</em> in the array. <strong>.unshift(item)</strong> will put a new item in the <em>first position</em> of the array, and <strong>.shift()</strong> will remove the <em>first item</em> in the array.</p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, ‘Raj’];\n\nstudentNames.unshift('Ryan');\n\nconsole.log(studentNames); // ['Ryan', 'Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'Raj']\n\nstudentNames.shift();\n\nconsole.log(studentNames); // ['Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'Raj']</pre>\n<h4>Notes on Arrays</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Because Javascript is not a strongly typed language, arrays do not need to be typed either. Arrays in Javascript can contains multiple different data types in the same array.</em></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/memD2HEKVyw?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E2AZxFTleCk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

Just like a variable holds a single piece of data (a string, a number or a boolean value) an array holds multiple pieces of data. Items in an array don&#8217;t have to be the same type, so they can contain strings and boolean values, for example. Strings are enclosed in quotation marks, and each item is separated by a comma.</p>\n<p>An array is declared just like a variable, but after the equals sign, it has brackets ([]). Optionally, data can be immediately stored in the array, during its creation. A common misconception is that an array is a collection of variables &#8211; which it is in other programming languages. In JavaScript, its a single variable with a collection of data, or <em>elements. </em></p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In the first Javascript lesson we discussed the 3 basic data types (strings, numbers, and booleans), and how to assign those data types to variables. We discussed how a variable can only point to a single string, number, or boolean. In many cases though we want to be able to point to a collection of data types. For example what if we wanted to keep track of every student’s name in this class using a single variable, studentsNames. We can do that using Arrays. We can think of arrays as storage containers for collections of data. Building an array is simple, declare a variable and set it to []. We can then add however many strings, numbers, or booleans as we want to the container (comma separated), and access those items whenever we want.</em></p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = ['Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'Raj'];\n\nlet bands = ['Godflesh', 'Pitch Shifter', 'Ministry', 'Cold World']</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_arrays.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Arrays</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array\">Mozilla Developer Network: Array</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/arrays-in-javascript/\">GeeksforGeeks: Arrays in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Accessing Items in an Array</h4>\n<p>Elements are indexed (or numbered/counted) starting at 0, so the first item in an array is item 0, the second is 1, the third is 2, and so on. Due to this, the length of an array is the number of actual elements in it, minus 1. Elements are called by their index number, preceded by the name of the array.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We can access an item at anytime in an array, we just need to call the item by its position in the array. Items are given a numerical position (index) according to where it is in the array, in order. An array’s numerical order ALWAYS starts at 0, so the first item is in the 0 index, the second in the 1 index, the third in the 2, and so on (this can be tricky at first, but just remember arrays always start at 0).</em></p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = ['Dan', 'Maria', 'Sara', 'Raj'];\n                         0       1       2       3</pre>\n<p>To access an item in an array, type the name of the array variable, followed by brackets containing the numerical assignment/index:</p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, ‘Raj’];\n\nconsole.log(studentNames[1]); // 'Maria'</pre>\n<pre>let bands = ['Godflesh', 'Pitch Shifter', 'Ministry', 'Cold World']\n\nconsole.log(bands[3]); // 'Cold World'</pre>\n<p>Like functions, arrays have their own <a href=\"https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/javascript-reference/javascript-array-object.php\"><strong>built-in methods</strong></a>.

In our studentsNames array, the length is 4. We know the first item is always going to be 0, and every item after is shifted over one number. So in our example the last item has an index of 3. Using our length property we will show how it is done when we don’t know the number of items in an array:</em></p>\n<pre>const studentsNames = [‘Dan’, ‘Maria’, ‘Sara’, … ,’Raj’];\n\nconsole.log(studentNames[studentNames.length - 1]); // 'Raj'</pre>\n<h4>Assignment</h4>\n<p>The value of elements in an array can be changed.

There are two scopes: <strong>global</strong> scope and <strong>local</strong> scope. Local scope includes variables, functions and objects <em>inside</em> of a function. Global scope includes those elements that are <em>not inside</em> of a function. There is only one global scope, but there can be as many local scopes as there are functions in a JavaScript program.</p>\n<p>The main purpose of scope is to limit access to resources so that they&#8217;re only available where needed. This theoretically makes bugs easier to contain and also allows the safe reuse of variable names in different functions.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Scope is defined as what variables we currently have access to and where. So far in this course, we have been working in Global scope, in that we can access any variable we have created, anywhere in our code. There are a couple different levels of scope: you may have heard of block level scope (used in if statements and for loops) in which a variable using either let or const is only available within the statement or loop.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_scope.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Scope</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://scotch.io/tutorials/understanding-scope-in-javascript\">Scotch.io: Understanding Scope in JavaScript</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope\">Mozilla Developer Network: Scope</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Function Level Scope</h4>\n<p>Function level scope allows the creation of variables inside of functions that are essentially private to that function. A JavaScript program cannot reach into a function from outside and access these variables, but variables created inside of a function can be used anywhere within the given function.</p>\n<p>Conversely, functions DO have access to variables from outside of the function, aka global variables. Functions can reach out and access variables outside of their scope, but a program cannot reach into a function to get a variable.</p>\n<pre>const var1 = ‘Lambda’\nfunction myFunc(){\n  const var2 = ‘School’\n  console.log(var1) // Lambda\n  console.log(var2) // School\n}\n\nconsole.log(var1) // Lambda\nconsole.log(var2) // undefined</pre>\n<h4>The return Statement</h4>\n<p>Function level scope limits access to variables inside of a function &#8211; only that function (and any functions nested inside of the given function) has access to those variables. Code from outside of the given function cannot see the variables inside of it. A program might need data that was processed inside of a function to continue to operate, however. This data can be sent out from inside of a function to a global variable using the <strong>return</strong> keyword.</p>\n<p>The way I imagine it (because I think with my stomach) is like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A program sends global variables to a function like a cook sends a burger patty, bacon, cheese and a bun to a prep station (the prep station is the function and the ingredients are the variables).</li>\n<li>The function does something with the variables, so to continue the analogy, the cook combines the ingredients into a burger, essentially performing a function on them.</li>\n<li>The cook then places the burger on a tray (the processed variables have their values updated).</li>\n<li>Finally, the burger is taken from the tray and placed on a plate for the hungry person waiting for it (the function returns the updated values of the variables to a global variable outside of the function).</li>\n</ol>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We will not console.log everything that comes out of a function. Most likely we will want to return something. There is one way we can access data from within a function. In fact, it is the only way for us to get ANY data from a function, and that is to use the keyword return. Think of the return statement as the only way for data to escape a function. Nothing other than what is returned can be accessed outside of the function. Also note that when a function hits a return statement, the function immediately stops what it is doing and returns.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We can also assign the value of a return statement to another variable, and we will now have access to the data returned from the function.</em></p>\n<pre>function addTwoNumbers( a, b ) {\n  const sum = a + b;\n  return sum;\n  console.log(‘This will never be reached’);\n}\n\nconst newSum = addTwoNumbers( 1, 2 );\nconsole.log(sum) // undefined\nconsole.log(newSum) // 3;</pre>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>* Note: We will never be able to have access to the actual variable created in the function. We will only have access to the data that variable was assigned to.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_return.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Return statement</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.
