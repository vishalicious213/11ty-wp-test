When we learned about it in the pre-course, we learned that when used in an object <em>this</em> refers to the object that its nested inside of. Day 3 dug a little deeper.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>You can think of this, as a Pointer to an object. </em>For example:<em> you can use the this keyword to reference an object without having to refer to that object’s name.</em></p>\n<p>Understanding what <em>this</em> points to requires context. An example we were given is to imagine that we&#8217;re at a friend&#8217;s house for dinner. At some point, she says, &#8220;I don&#8217;t like this.&#8221; In order to understand what <em>this</em> means, we look at our friend and see that she&#8217;s pointing at our cat, scratching at her leg. Without seeing her point, we&#8217;d have no context to define what <em>this</em> refers to.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The first place to start with the this keyword is to understand not how a function is being called, but ‘where’. If you can discover the context in which the function being called is executed, you’ll have a clue as to what the ‘this’ keyword is pointing to.</em></p>\n<h4>The Four Rules of Binding</h4>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Window/Global Object Binding</strong>: In the global scope, the value of  <em>this</em> is the window/console object/</li>\n<li><strong>Implicit Binding</strong>: When a function is called by a preceding dot, <em>this</em> is the object before the dot. This is the most common application of <em>this</em> (see what I did there?).</li>\n<li><strong>New Binding</strong>: When a constructor function is used, <em>this</em> refers to the instance of the object that the constructor function created and returned. <em>(Constructor functions were covered the next day in class.)</em></li>\n<li><strong>Explicit Binding</strong>: When JavaScript&#8217;s <strong>.call</strong> or <strong>.apply</strong> method is used, <em>this</em> is explicitly defined.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I&#8217;ll write a post later and go more into this/<em>this</em>, with code examples of the bindings, but I just don&#8217;t have the reserves right now (its 4:51 AM!).</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wesbos.com/arrow-function-no-no/\">When not to use arrow functions</a></strong><a href=\"https://wesbos.com/arrow-function-no-no/\"> </a><em>(this</em> doesn&#8217;t bind to arrow functions!)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3></h3>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"896\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/31/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-3/2019-08-21-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.21 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=1024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-896\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.08.21 1\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h3>Prototypes</h3>\n<p>Like <em>this,</em> <strong>object prototypes</strong> are a concept that was covered the <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-pre-course-21-learn-to-explain-the-prototype-how-and-why-we-use-it/\"><strong>pre-course</strong></a>. I was comfortable with my understanding of it then, and I actually still am now. I think of a prototype as a mold. In manufacturing, many items (or parts of items) are crafted from molds. They can be looked at as a blueprint or template for objects that will be created in their image.</p>\n<p>In JavaScript, when an object is created, it automatically gets a prototype. This prototype is applied to all subsequent instances of that object that are created. For example, if we have an &#8220;Animal&#8221; object and we create an Animal called &#8220;dog&#8221;, then dog will inherit whatever characteristics Animal has. If we create another Animal called &#8220;cat&#8221; then it, too, will inherit whatever characteristics Animal has. It gets these from the prototype &#8211; the blueprint of the object.</p>\n<p>The main function of the prototype is that new methods can be attached to it which are then inherited by all objects in its type. So, to continue with our Animal example, if we add a method (a function that&#8217;s attached to an object, array or string) to the Animal prototype called &#8220;wagsTail&#8221; then our dog and cat objects will gain access to the wagsTail method. (<em>Now that I&#8217;m thinking about it, we&#8217;ll need to include a property in the Animal object that indicates if the Animal actually has a tail to wag, or we&#8217;ll get some disturbing behaviors from gorillas or octopuses or maybe animals that are practically all-tail, like snakes.</em>)</p>\n<p>Animal is a <strong>constructor function</strong>. It creates (constructs) objects that inherit its characteristics and methods. Its a convention to name constructors (shorthand for constructor functions) with a capitalized first letter. This lets other developers know that the function is a constructor.</p>\n<p>But, anyway, the point of all of this is that when a constructor creates a new object (using the <strong>new</strong> keyword) it basically creates a context for <em>this. </em>It returns a <em>this</em> object with properties inherited from the constructor added on.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"897\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/31/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-3/2019-08-21-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.21 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=1024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-897\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.08.21 2\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.21-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h4>Why use prototypes for methods?</h4>\n<p>So, what&#8217;s the difference between defining a method in an object directly vs. attaching it to the prototype? My understanding is that its a memory/resource management concern. If we define a method in an object, it&#8217;s natively a part of all children of that object. However, its then duplicated across all child objects, so memory is reserved for it. For small programs, that might not be a concern, but for programs with large amounts of object data &#8211; lets say a scenario in which 50k children of a constructor function are created &#8211; that means that the method was just duplicated 50k times.</p>\n<p>Attaching a method to a prototype allows all child objects to access the method, but doesn&#8217;t copy it directly into every instance of that object. In essence, dog or cat can reference wagsTail and use it, but its not inherently a part of their makeup.</p>\n<p>Ok. I&#8217;m beat. I&#8217;ll write about <strong>inheritance,</strong> <strong>dunder prototypes</strong> and show some prototype code examples later. For now, good morning to all of you, and good nigh for me for the next hour or two.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;ve been meaning to write about days 3-5 of JavaScript week, but I just finished my first build week and I&#8217;m too tired to really go into detail, but I need to push it out of the way before I write about Week 4.

me right between the eyes. <strong>Callbacks.</strong> I understand them theoretically, but even now, I confuse myself when trying to implement them. I didn&#8217;t complete our Day 2 project/homework on Day 2. I didn&#8217;t complete it on Day 3 either. I finally got it together on <em>Day 4!</em> Yes &#8211; the day before our weekly Sprint Challenge. There&#8217;s a learning curve. Its supposed to get easier. Just, not this week. This day was the start of the hardest week I&#8217;ve had so far.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"874\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-2/week3-day2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1034,780\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week3 day2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-874\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=1034&#038;h=780\" alt=\"week3 day2\" width=\"1034\" height=\"780\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg 1034w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=113 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=226 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=579 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=772 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px\" /></p>\n<h3>JavaScript II</h3>\n<p>So, Day 2 dealt with <strong>closure,</strong> <strong>callback functions</strong> and <strong>advanced JavaScript arrays</strong>. There was about an hour&#8217;s worth of video to watch, with a 15-minute video going over closure and two 25-minute videos going over callbacks in JavaScript and array methods, respectively.</p>\n<h4>Closure</h4>\n<p>Closure wasn&#8217;t too hard &#8211; at least not at the level in which we&#8217;re dealing with it. Its largely focused on what data a given part of a program (usually a function) has access to. Its similar to nesting in most languages. There&#8217;s a hierarchy, and basically outside functions can&#8217;t access data from functions further in. Its like having tiered defensive walls surrounding a castle, or having higher and higher levels of security clearance with the government. The information that&#8217;s deeper in is only knowable to functions on that level. Those deeper functions can still reach outward and get information from their parent, grandparent and earlier ancestor functions.</p>\n<h4>Callback functions</h4>\n<p>Callback functions beat me up pretty badly. The main idea is simply this: a callback function is a function that can take another function as a parameter. That&#8217;s all there is to it. The function being used as the parameter/variable is referred to as the <strong>callback</strong> (or <strong>cb,</strong> for short). Its a common practice to always use the word &#8220;callback&#8221; as the parameter&#8217;s name when defining function that will use it, and inside of that function, its a common practice to refer to it as &#8220;cb&#8221;.</p>\n<p>This is a function t<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">hat takes a name and says hello to it:</span></p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code>  <span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">greet</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">console</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"nx\">log</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s2\">`Hello, </span><span class=\"p\">${</span><span class=\"nx\">name</span><span class=\"p\">}</span><span class=\"s2\">`</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>This is a callback function that uses the &#8220;greet&#8221; function, above:</p>\n<pre class=\"highlight\"><code> <span class=\"kd\">function</span> <span class=\"nx\">greetVish</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">callback</span><span class=\"p\">)</span> <span class=\"p\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"kd\">const</span> <span class=\"nx\">innerName</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"s1\">'Vish'</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"nx\">callback</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"nx\">innerName</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n  <span class=\"p\">}</span></code></pre>\n<p>The callback in greetVish will become &#8220;greet&#8221; when its invoked using &#8220;greet&#8221; as a parameter.</p>\n<pre>greetVish(greet);</pre>\n<p>greetVish executes &#8220;greet&#8221; as its callback and passes innerName to &#8220;greet&#8221; as its parameter. As expected, it console logs &#8220;Hello, Vish&#8221;. We can then just change innerName and it can callback &#8220;greet&#8221; and say hello to anyone we want.</p>\n<p>See? Its simple in theory. I don&#8217;t know why I can&#8217;t execute it without staring at each letter in the function for 5 minutes and rewriting every callback function I&#8217;ve attempted until 12 hours have passed. I think some of it is when we start to combine it with anonymous functions, and with arrow functions. It might also be lack of sleep.</p>\n<p>I also now notice that I could have called it greetGroot and had innerName = &#8220;Groot&#8221; and then the callback could have said &#8220;My name is Groot.&#8221; Missed opportunity&#8230;</p>\n<p>Ok. So, then we started to complicate things by learning that callbacks are used all over the place&#8230; like in array methods. We saw how we could use a for look to iterate over every item in an array and perform a task. Then we saw how the .forEach array method could do the same thing with one line of code. This led to us writing callback functions that took an array and a callback as two parameters and did stuff to the individual elements in the array. Because they were functions, we could use them on different arrays. Being callbacks, we could also modify them for use with different methods (create a callback that returns the first item in a given array, create a callback that shows the length of a given array).</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_884\" style=\"width: 1376px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-884\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"884\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-2/2019-08-20-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.20 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-884\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.08.20 1\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.20-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-884\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Higher Order Functions with Britt</p></div>\n<h4>Array methods</h4>\n<p>After the above, we moved on to array methods, starting with a comparison of <strong>.forEach</strong> and <strong>.map.</strong> The big difference between the two of them (each iterates over the entire given array) is that .map returns a new array without modifying the original, while .forEach mutates the original array.  Also, .forEach doesn&#8217;t give us back anything, but .map returns a new array. We also experimented with <strong>.reduce</strong> and <strong>.filter</strong> and were exposed to the word <strong>immutability,</strong> which apparently becomes very important in <strong>React.</strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Day 2 of JavaScript Week hit me right between the eyes.

School was hard. It was called JavaScript Fundamentals, and it really tested my ability to keep up. I never went to bed before 2:30 AM. I was up working on projects and studying every night. There were 2 nights that I went up at 4 AM and on the night before the Sprint Challenge, I went up at 5:30 AM. I was basically an absentee father for most of the day, all week.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a recap, as best as I can remember. Lack of rest has clouded my head, but so far, this new week (Week 4) has been easier&#8230; and yes, that means that I passed the Sprint Challenge.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"865\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-1/week3-day1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1034,757\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week3 day1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-865\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=1034&#038;h=757\" alt=\"week3 day1\" width=\"1034\" height=\"757\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg 1034w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=110 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=220 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=562 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week3-day1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=750 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1034px) 100vw, 1034px\" /></p>\n<h3>JavaScript I</h3>\n<p>Monday was the start of JavaScript Week and was the easiest day. I thought we might go over some of the pre-course topics as a warm-up and then begin exploring new ones on Day 2, but I was wrong. We jumped right into the water.</p>\n<p>At first blush, the day&#8217;s topics looked familiar enough: variables, arrays, objects and functions. These were all things covered prior to admission. Of course, I hadn&#8217;t really touched JavaScript <em>since</em> then. I was focusing on HTML, CSS and LESS, so I was rusty. LESS, from Week 2, resembled JavaScript, and it seemed meant to segue to more complex programming, which is what the week would bring.</p>\n<p>Prior to class, we had to watch 4 videos covering function basics, variables, object literals and arrays. These totaled almost an hour-and-a-half in length. There was a lot of information, and it built on the pre-course material without backtracking very much.</p>\n<p>Function declarations, invocation, arguments, parameters and return statements were all old-hat, but then we got into <strong>hoisting</strong> (and two-pass compiling), <strong>function expressions</strong>, <strong>anonymous functions</strong> and <strong>arrow functions</strong>. I was able to follow all of this, so far, and the analysis of using <strong>let</strong> over <strong>var</strong> for variable declarations (and the advice to use <strong>const</strong> until we can&#8217;t, and then use let). All of this led to discussion about <strong>scope</strong> of course; especially with regard to let, var and hoisting.</p>\n<p><strong>Object literals</strong> came next. I was able to follow along, even though I was out of practice with JavaScript&#8230; but then came <strong>arrays</strong> and my old frenemies <strong>.push, .unshift, .pop</strong> and <strong>.shift.</strong> Our project dealt with objects, arrays and then arrow function syntax.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_869\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-869\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"869\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/27/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-1/2019-08-19-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.19 3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-869\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"2019.08.19 3.jpg\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019.08.19-3.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-869\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My group!</p></div>\n<p>The initial object exercises weren&#8217;t difficult. Creating objects, reading object data and using select object methods made sense to me. Arrays began to change that. We had to code answers to problems involving finding specific objects in an array, finding pairs of data in an array, sorting elements of an array and returning the results, creating a new array out of a subset of an old one, listing all items in an array that had a certain mathematical quality in common, and using <strong>JSON</strong> to show the results of another array we made out of a subset of data from another array. This section really tested me and kept me up all night. Google, YouTube and a bunch of websites were my guides and lack of sleep was my sputtering fuel. I struggled to answer the questions and write code. I didn&#8217;t intuit what methods to use and my notes weren&#8217;t what they should have been.

Challenge, and it went a little better than the first one. This time around, the challenge covered <strong>responsive design</strong> and <strong>preprocessing</strong>. We were asked to build a small proof-of-concept website for <em>Spacewalkers Magazine</em>&#8216;s marketing team. Design files for desktop and mobile views were provided, and much of the homepage was already coded. We had to finish the navigation, header and the mobile styles.</p>\n<p>For Minimum Viable Product (MVP), we had to import 7 files into our index.less file in a specific order. Then we had to add a viewport meta tag to the index.html head. Next, we had to build the missing navigation system and add a header image (which was provided with our assets). There were specific .less files we were asked to use for styling specific areas of the page. We had to create and use two different mixins to aid with styling, and add those to a specific .less file. We also had to create a parametric mixin with at least two parameters and use it to style the button at the bottom of the site. Finally, for the desktop view, we had to create a hover state that swapped background color and font color for the base button styles.</p>\n<p>The mobile design had a max-width of 500px. We had to match the styling on the design document as best as we could and had to create a media query string that used a specific variable for nested mobile styling.</p>\n<p>There were four stretch goals available if we were able to complete MVP in a timely fashion: build a page of our choosing from the navigation items and come up with content and images that fit the theme; introduce CSS animations to the site; create a fixed navigation and add opacity to the background; create a form that would allow someone to sign up for a Spacewalkers Magazine subscription.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-5-sprint-challenge\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

Last time, I answered the self-study questions first and then headed into the coding project. This time, I worked on the project first and then answered the self-study questions. I found that I was really pressed for time when answering the questions this time around. I had about 5 mins to answer 5 questions, so my answers were abbreviated, compared to the first time. I also didn&#8217;t complete adding all of the mixins that were needed for MVP, because I&#8217;m so slow. Reed (our TL) looked over my work later on, during our 1-on-1 meeting and I demonstrated that I knew the material, so he let me create the mixins after our meeting and submit them to him. He seems to recognize that I&#8217;m slow to implement. I&#8217;m hoping to get faster, because I know the material and can walk others through my code and explain concepts. I&#8217;m just not fast at setting it all up initially.</p>\n<p>I started working on a cheat sheet to reference and speed up my coding, an hour before the challenge. It did help. I was able to use code snippets from it as templates for certain parts of the web page, like the navigation area and mixins.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think that I have a stronger grasp of the material this week, but I haven&#8217;t internalized it to the point in which I can just recall and implement quickly yet.</p>\n<p>This coming week is JavaScript, and next week will be our first build week, in which we create a complete product website working with teams from other tracks &#8211; like people studying user design or iOS programming or something else. This has me worried, but whatever happens, it&#8217;ll be an experience.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, this Friday was my second Sprint Challenge, and it went a little better than the first one.

Still, some part of me wanted to vomit it up and get it out, so here it is, as a separate post.</p>\n<h3>Background</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve mentioned previously that one of the roles I took on at work was that of lead designer for our EMR. I used <strong>FrontPage</strong> and then <strong>Expression Web</strong>, coupled with <strong>Visual Studio</strong> to update the front-end of our existing modules and create new pieces as well. With what I&#8217;ve learned in only 2 weeks at Lambda, I feel confident that I could now do a lot of that design by hand, albeit much more slowly than when I worked with the aforementioned programs to do it. I now understand more of what goes on under the hood of a web page. There are absolutely changes I&#8217;d make to my initial workflow &#8211; some of it is based on having a small bit of knowledge of HTML/CSS/LESS and some of it is based on advancing technology.</p>\n<p>When I joined the company, most of the installations of our software were done on local servers at our client facilities. We followed the client/server model and the facility servers would share our application to the facility&#8217;s users and had to run a local database as well. Yes, licensing for all of this can get expensive. This was in the early 2000s, and had been the case since the mid/late 1990s, before I was a part of the company. Since then, I helped move us to a centralized server at a large datacenter, and we switched to sharing our application via <strong>Citrix</strong> and <strong>Terminal Services</strong>. This, naturally made updating the system easier (no more driving for hours to clients in upstate NY and all over the city with disks to perform program updates, or mailing them to facilities with a tech person). That was our state for several years, and finally, maybe around 2008/2009 we transitioned from being a <strong>Powerbuilder</strong> application to the web. The entire program was reconstructed using HTML/CSS/JS for the front-end and C++ (with snippets of Visual Basic) on the back-end. We used MS-SQL as our database.</p>\n<p>We have one genius developer who essentially single-handedly converted our entire application. His role was previously relegated to creating all of the reports that our system produced using SQL and <strong>Crystal Reports</strong>, and he used some Powerbuilder to help with that, because our main developer(s) had initially used it to write the program.  Converting to web was a big step for us. It was something that he had suggested at least 2 years prior, and I had backed him on, but our founder was concerned about development time and resources to make the change. It was unknown territory for us. He convinced us that he could do it, and lo-and-behold, he was right.</p>\n<p>I have a lot of regrets about not knowing how to code, back when this was all happening. Our web developer largely soloed the mission. I helped with error-trapping and revising logic and parts of the design during the transition, but didn&#8217;t actually touch the real design until a few years later.</p>\n<p>Anyway, <strong>HTML5</strong> had only recently become a standard, so the majority of the browsers that our clients used didn&#8217;t support it. Our web implementation was built around <strong>HTML4,</strong> and whatever CSS version was available at the time (I&#8217;m going to assume it was CSS2). Nursing homes aren&#8217;t like hospitals. They don&#8217;t have very modern technology, and they&#8217;re slow to adopt it. Responsive design was similarly new in our sphere. I don&#8217;t think many of our competitors supported it, except maybe with select modules that were designed specifically for use at the bedside or on the go (like with physical therapy, or occupational therapy).</p>\n<p>There were so many design ideas that I had, and so many design specs that I created that we weren&#8217;t able to implement, largely because they relied on HTML5 and I didn&#8217;t even know the difference between that and HTML4 at the time. Its a different world now. Two weeks at Lambda has shown me how to implement a lot of what was on my wish-list back then, and the majority of the facilities we worked with have upgraded their computers and terminals to specs that can now support HTML5/CSS3.</p>\n<p>My company is slowly dissolving. We no longer take on new clients and have been mainly operating is maintenance mode. I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to last more than 5 more years, which is why I&#8217;m pursuing a switch from my current skillsets in networking and support to development. I&#8217;ve worked with our development team for years, and I&#8217;ve always wanted to BE part of that team. I have hopes of converting our front-end to HTML5 and CSS3, and making it responsive. If we don&#8217;t actually implement it to existing clients, its still a learning experience, and its also wish-fulfillment on my part. We&#8217;ll see in a year from now if I&#8217;ve been able to act on any of it. Right now, Lambda, alone, is occupying most of my time. When I couple that with family life and writing this blog, it leaves me scant time to spend on anything big; but I&#8217;ve read that the first few months are the hardest for a lot of people, so if I&#8217;m lucky, I&#8217;ll actually be able to apply what I&#8217;m learning to my old work project sooner than later. I&#8217;m not looking forward to poring over CMS requirements and changes to Medicare and Medicaid and nursing standards and all the rest that comes with it, but if it allows me to build and develop and craft something meaningful, I&#8217;m more than willing to tackle it.</p>\n<p>When our founder passed, she left the company to us as part of her legacy. Its always been a personal desire of mine to transform it into something that would make her proud. I know some of the places that she wanted to take the system, and I&#8217;ve had designs about how to go about doing that for years. I finally feel like I&#8217;m gaining the tools necessary to actually act on it.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So I wrote this when I was writing my Week 2 Day 4 summary earlier today, but then realized that I had gone off onto a tangent and took it out.

School: Full Stack – Week 2, Day 4","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/18/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-4/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-d7","content":"<p>Week 2, Day 4 of Full Stack web development at Lambda School continued with preprocessing using LESS (LEan Style Sheets). We learned about <strong>parametric mixins</strong>, <strong>functions</strong>, and <strong>escaping</strong> as well as <strong>importing</strong> .less files into a single .css file for use by the browser to style a website (and, of course, we implemented all of this in our project).</p>\n<h3>Parametric Mixins</h3>\n<p>Parametric mixins are mixins that accept <strong>arguments</strong> and <strong>parameters.</strong> They&#8217;re essentially JavaScript functions. Their format is the same as writing a style that operates on a class in CSS, but with a pair of parenthesis in-place before the curly brackets, to pass parameters to the mixin.</p>\n<p>The following is a parametric mixin that I wrote for one of my projects. It uses variables (arguments/parameters) to change the color of a button and its text (actually a &lt;div&gt; styled to look like a button), so that the overall appearance of the website can responsively change based on media query.</p>\n<pre>.styleButton(@btnText, @btnColor) {\n  display: flex;\n  color: @btnText;\n  background-color: @btn-bg-color;\n  width: 30%;\n  height: 10%;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n  font-size: 1.5rem;\n  justify-content: center;\n  align-items: center;\n}</pre>\n<p>So, although a standard mixin reduces the amount of code that we might need to rewrite for parts of a program that use it, they&#8217;re also inflexible. They really only do one thing. Parametric mixins allow a mixin to become more dynamic, by virtue of incorporating variables (which can actually be other mixins as well!).</p>\n<p>Its easy for new developers who have just discovered mixins to create them for everything, but we were cautioned to make certain that there are enough use cases for them, to avoid adding unnecessary complexity to projects. Often, a simple class can accomplish what we need. The main question to ask is whether the mixin will be used many times in the program, or only a few.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"842\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/18/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-4/week2-day4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1102,696\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week2 day4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-842\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=1102&#038;h=696\" alt=\"week2 day4\" width=\"1102\" height=\"696\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg 1102w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=95 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=189 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=485 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day4.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=647 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1102px) 100vw, 1102px\" /></p>\n<h3>Functions</h3>\n<p>Functions are pre-built code that are part of LESS. They remind me of built-in methods in JavaScript. There are many types of functions. A quick look at the LESS documentations shows the following categories:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Logical functions</li>\n<li>String functions</li>\n<li>List functions</li>\n<li>Math functions</li>\n<li>Type functions</li>\n<li>Misc functions</li>\n<li>Color Definition functions</li>\n<li>Color Channel functions</li>\n<li>Color Operator functions</li>\n<li>Color Blending functions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Functions generally return a value &#8211; something common in programming languages, but new to more declarative languages like CSS. We looked at a few select functions during the lecture. I remember a pair that darkened or lightened a color, without the programmer needing to actually know the name or any kind of code for the given color.</p>\n<pre>.btn-class {\n  padding: 10px 40px;\n  border-radius: 10px;\n  background-color: teal;\n  color: white;\n  cursor: pointer;\n\n  &amp;:hover {\n  // The compiled color returned is #006667 \n  background-color: darken(teal, 5%)\n  }\n} // .btn-class</pre>\n<p>There are really too many functions to cover all at once, but here&#8217;s a link to all of them from the LESS documentation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://lesscss.org/functions/\">LESS Functions</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Escaping</h3>\n<p>Escaping is a tool that&#8217;s mainly used with media queries. It allows a string to be stored as a variable to help keep code from having to be retyped. The format is like this:</p>\n<pre>~\"string value\"</pre>\n<p>During the lecture, we were shown a &lt;h1&gt; heading that has a base font-size and padding which changed at different widths, to accommodate different screen sizes. The initial code was pretty static, and the problem with it was that if we had different elements all over the program that needed to be reconfigured at certain breakpoints, but the width for those breakpoints changed, we&#8217;d have to search for every instance of those individual changes at each resolution to change them. without escaping.</p>\n<p>With escaping, we  could assign a string value to the media query and keep it stored, centrally, in the program. We could then easily change and incorporate it into the program by simply altering the string from one place.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s &lt;h1&gt; code without escaping:</p>\n<pre>h1 {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  padding: 10px;\n\n  @media( min-width: 500px ) {\n  padding: 20px;\n  }\n\n  @media( min-width: 800px ) {\n  font-size: 1.8rem;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n  }\n} // h1</pre>\n<p>And here it is WITH escaping:</p>\n<pre>@tablet: ~\"(min-width: 500px)\";\n@desktop: ~\"(min-width: 800px)\";\n\nh1 {\n  font-size: 2rem;\n  padding: 10px;\n\n  @media @tablet {\n  padding: 20px;\n  }\n\n  @media @desktop {\n  font-size: 1.8rem;\n  padding: 0 10px;\n  }\n} // h1</pre>\n<p>Note the @tablet and @desktop variables. Changing these would immediately update every occurrence of the given media queries and allow the program to be globally updated from one spot.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"843\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/18/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-4/4-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1040,710\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"4-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-843\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=1040&#038;h=710\" alt=\"4-1\" width=\"1040\" height=\"710\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg 1040w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=102 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=205 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=524 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/4-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=699 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1040px) 100vw, 1040px\" /></p>\n<h3>Importing</h3>\n<p>CSS files can get big. We were told that we&#8217;ll see CSS files with thousands of lines of code, and I remember actually seeing one with several thousands of lines only last week: it was the CSS for the portfolio project (Week 2, Day 2). We picked a template to customize, and I distinctly remember at least 4,000 lines of code in the CSS of the one I chose.</p>\n<p>Using imports basically allows us to use smaller files to style different sections of our web page and then combine them together into one file for actual display. It makes code more manageable, especially for larger projects, and also allows different people or teams to work on different sections of a website without adversely impacting each other.</p>\n<p>The syntax in LESS is as follows:</p>\n<pre>@import 'filename';</pre>\n<p>We used an &#8220;index.less&#8221; file to import all of our .less files. Cascading matters! So, we were told to generally import variables and mixins first, any resets or normalizing next, then general styles, and then styles for individual sections. If the files are in the same folder as the main .less file, their extensions can be left out. I kept mine in though, just to be safe.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n<pre>// Vars and Mixins\n@import \"variables\";\n@import \"mixins\";\n\n// General Styles Here\n@import \"reset\";\n@import \"general-styles\";\n\n// Components Here\n@import \"header\";\n@import \"cta\";\n@import \"main-content\";\n@import \"contact\";\n@import \"footer\";</pre>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-4\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 647px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"647\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 370px; height: 647px;\" data-original-width=\"370\" data-original-height=\"647\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-desktop.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"366\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"643\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"840\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-desktop.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,1405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fun-bus-desktop\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-desktop.jpg?w=171\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-desktop.jpg?w=583\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-desktop.jpg?w=366&#038;h=643&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"366\" height=\"643\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"366\" data-original-height=\"643\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"fun-bus-desktop\" alt=\"desktop\" style=\"width: 366px; height: 643px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> desktop </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 130px; height: 647px;\" data-original-width=\"130\" data-original-height=\"647\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-mobile.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"126\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"643\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"841\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-mobile.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"508,2594\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fun-bus-mobile\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-mobile.jpg?w=59\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-mobile.jpg?w=201\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/fun-bus-mobile.jpg?w=126&#038;h=643&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"126\" height=\"643\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"126\" data-original-height=\"643\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"fun-bus-mobile\" alt=\"mobile\" style=\"width: 126px; height: 643px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> mobile </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<h3>Project</h3>\n<p>Our Preprocessing II project was to update the website for the Fun Bus travel agency. We had to add a new navigation, header and buttons to the home page and then style a mobile version of the website &#8211; and we had to use preprocessors. It was important for us to keep the less-watch-compiler running on Git Bash, so that it would automatically compile our .less files and output it to a single .css file when we saved and page in the project. We had to import 7 .less files into our main .less file as well. The buttons on the page needed to be styled using a parametric mixin, and the mobile breakpoint had to be called using escaping. For both the desktop and mobile versions, we had to match the provided design documents as closely as possible.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get to work on any of the stretch goals, which were to create an animation mixin using parametric mixins, add a form that allowed users to select a vacation package (with inputs for select fields) and then style the site to look good at all sizes, not just desktop and mobile.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Week 2, Day 4 of Full Stack web development at Lambda School continued with preprocessing using LESS (LEan Style Sheets).

School: Full Stack – Week 2, Day 3","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/18/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-3/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-cQ","content":"<p>When I first heard the word <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preprocessor\"><strong>preprocessor</strong></a>, I thought it had to do with hardware and making use of some kind of main or secondary processor chips. W<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">ith regard to CSS,</span><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\"> i</span><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">t turns out that its a language extension! A preprocessor is a program that takes data, processes it and then passes that data on to another program to use.</span></p>\n<p>So, on Week 2, Day 3 at Lambda School, we learned about preprocessing by using <strong>LESS</strong> (LEaner Style Sheets) to style a guided project and then our own project for the day (along with some code-alongs in CodePen). LESS is a programming language unto itself. My understanding is that code in LESS is compiled by a JavaScript compiler, which turns it into CSS. We didn&#8217;t do any work with CSS files for Days 3 and 4 of the week. Instead, we worked with LESS files and HTML files. The LESS files then compiled and were merged onto a single CSS document (index.css). It was an interesting process to observe.</p>\n<p>LESS reminds me a lot of the <strong>JavaScript</strong> that I worked through in the bulk of the pre-course to get into Lambda. While CSS does a lot, especially when adding new components like <strong>Flexbox</strong> (and what I&#8217;ve seen of <strong>Grid</strong>). its still very similar to HTML in that its a declarative language. There&#8217;s no <em>logic</em> involved in coding in CSS; its really just a series of command issuances. LESS adds a lot to CSS: variables, nesting, mixins (which are like user-defined functions), operators and baked-in functions. So yes, in 2 weeks, we dived into learning at least the basics of 3 complimentary languages.</p>\n<p>The three most-used CSS preprocessors are SASS, LESS and Stylus. SASS is very similar to LESS in format. Our instructor, Britt, actually learned SASS in her own bootcamp and learned LESS in a single day to teach it to us. This article goes over some of the differences. Its really interesting to compare LESS and SASS code in it and see how close they are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://htmlmag.com/article/an-introduction-to-css-preprocessors-sass-less-stylus\">HTMLMAG: An Introduction to CSS Pre-Processors: SASS, LESS and Stylus</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"806\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/18/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-3/week2-day3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1102,743\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week2 day3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-806\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=1102&#038;h=743\" alt=\"week2 day3\" width=\"1102\" height=\"743\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg 1102w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=300&amp;h=202 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=768&amp;h=518 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day3.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=690 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1102px) 100vw, 1102px\" /></p>\n<h3>Set up</h3>\n<p>Our first matter of business was actually setting up LESS. This involved installing <strong><a href=\"https://nodejs.org/\">Node</a></strong>, which is an open-source JavaScript run-time that allows JavaScript to be run outside of a browser &#8211; like on the desktop. Next, we installed <strong><a href=\"https://yarnpkg.com/en/\">YARN</a></strong> &#8211; a package manager that we primarily used to share code in Git Bash. Finally, we installed <strong>less-watch-compiler</strong> using Git Bash. Its a program that monitors folders for file changes and automatically compiles .less files in the given folder/subfolders into CSS and outputs them into a .css file.</p>\n<p>Some people opted to use another package manager called <strong><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">NPM</a></strong>, over YARN, because of installation issues, but I ended up going with YARN because the commands to work with NPM once it had been installed were different from YARN and would have taken me longer to learn to use, considering my lack of familiarity with either.</p>\n<h3>LESS</h3>\n<p>On Day 3, we focused on the following features in LESS: <strong>variables, mixins, nesting, bubbling</strong> and <strong>operations</strong>.</p>\n<p><em>Variables</em> in LESS are written with a starting @ symbol. Like with other programming languages, they allow developers to store values for use in their code. We used them for font, color and width sizes, among other things.</p>\n<pre>@headingColor: #FF0000;</pre>\n<p><em>Mixins</em> are named for their ability to mix together different classes and use one class&#8217;s properties in another class. They very strongly resemble functions in JavaScript. They&#8217;re declared just like classes in CSS, but include a set of parenthesis before the curly brackets. Here&#8217;s an example mixin that takes two classes and fuses them:</p>\n<pre>.font-class {\n  color: black;\n  font-size: 18px;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.box-class {\n  width: 100px;\n  height: 100px;\n  background: gray;\n}\n\n.example-mixin {\n  .font-class();\n  .box-class();\n}</pre>\n<p><em>Nesting</em> is exactly what it sounds like from other programming languages. Its a technique used to organize code by indenting lines so that they are visually contained by &#8220;parent&#8221; code. They allow developers to quickly scan code and know which parts belong to other parts &#8211; parent objects/elements and child object/elements. We&#8217;re advised not to nest more than 4 levels deep, much like the movie Inception. As a bonus, nested code is collapsible in <strong>VS Code</strong> and other editors, so its easy to shrink-down lines of nested code to declutter the screen and also learn the hierarchy and structure of a given page of code.</p>\n<pre>.parent {\n  color: black;\n  font-size: 12px;\n  border: 1px solid black;\n  padding: 20px;\n\n  .child {\n    color: red;\n    font-size: 16px;\n    margin: 20px;\n\n    .grandchild {\n      width: 400px;\n      height: 100px;\n      background: gray;\n    }\n  } // child\n} // parent</pre>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-3\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 158px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"158\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 158px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"158\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-1.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"154\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"807\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"3-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-1.jpg?w=246&#038;h=154&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"154\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"154\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"3-1\" alt=\"background variable: dodgerblue\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 154px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> background variable: dodgerblue </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 158px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"158\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"154\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"808\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"3-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/3-2.jpg?w=246&#038;h=154&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"154\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"154\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"3-2\" alt=\"background variable: orange\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 154px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> background variable: orange </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p><em>Bubbling</em> is the idea that nested code &#8220;bubbles up&#8221; to wrap the selector that its nested in. Its important for techniques like nesting media queries in sections of code, instead of making separate sections of code to store media queries. The way we used it was so place media queries exactly where they were needed, to format elements for different screen sizes on the spot in the code, instead of grouping together elements that needed to be adjusted into a single area and altering their layout there.</p>\n<pre>.some-class {\n  // Large screen styling\n  width: 800px;\n  height: 100%;\n  background: gray;\n\n  // Medium screen styling\n  @media (max-width: 800px) {\n    width: 100%;\n    background: black;\n  }\n\n  // Small screen styling\n  @media (max-width: 500px) {\n    width: 80%;\n    background: green;\n  }\n} // .some-class</pre>\n<p><span style=\"background-color:#ffffff;color:var(--color-text);font-family:'Noto Serif', Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\">Operations are simple math operators, like in other programming languages.

I made one for myself, but I saw others that were really well-done for characters like Bruce Wayne (Batman), Walter White (Breaking Bad) and Jarlaxle Baenre (R.A. Salvatore&#8217;s Dark Elf books for The Forgotten Realms &#8211; I haven&#8217;t read D&amp;D novels since the 90s, but Salvatore&#8217;s were some of my favorites).</p>\n<p>We had to use the less-watch-compiler for this project. We were given a sample resume layout that we could build, if we didn&#8217;t want to make one of ourselves or pick a character. The content had to be provided by us and the page had to include a navigation with 4 items of our choosing, an intro about why we&#8217;d be a good hire, a skills section, work history and contact method. We had to incorporate variables for color and fonts, nest selectors in a main container, create 2 mixins and use nested at-rules to produce a mobile version of the resume at 500px max-width.</p>\n<p>Stretch goals included incorporating a Google font, linking to our portfolio page (from last week&#8217;s projects) and converting the Great Idea CSS from last weekinto LESS (with variables, mixins, nesting and so on). I was able to complete the Google font stretch goal and link my portfolio.</p>\n<p>Here’s my resume website, on GitHub Pages: <strong><a href=\"https://vishalicious213.github.io/Preprocessing-I/\">Vish Singh &#8211; Full-Stack Web Development Student at Lambda School</a></strong></p>\n<p>I did a few small things for the first time that weren&#8217;t included in the MVP (minimal viable product) for the project, or the stretch goals. I included font-awesome icons for social media accounts. I added tooltips to those icons, and I made a table in HTML for the work experience section, which I also added a hover effect to that styled the row that was being hovered over. It was fun to add these, as silly and simple as they are.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>When I first heard the word preprocessor, I thought it had to do with hardware and making use of some kind of main or secondary processor chips.

I completed my 2nd Sprint Challenge at Lambda School. We covered a lot of material in the past few days, and I was mostly able to keep up, although I&#8217;m still probably the slowest person in my group. I wrote more in-depth about <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/13/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-1/\"><strong>Week 2, Day 1</strong></a> on Monday, but haven&#8217;t had a chance to blog about the rest until now. Here&#8217;s a recap of the 2nd day of the week:</p>\n<h3>Monday &amp; Tuesday (Week 2, Days 1 &amp; 2)</h3>\n<p>So, this week&#8217;s unit is called <strong>Advanced CSS</strong>. We spent two days on <strong>Responsive Design</strong> and two days on <strong>Preprocessing</strong>. On Monday, we learned about things like the differences between fixed, fluid, adaptive and responsive layouts; media queries and breakpoints; and built our first responsive website.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, the focus was on responsive units of measurement. We created another responsive website and made use of responsive units of measurement like <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Em_(typography)\">em</a></strong> and <strong>rem</strong> (<em>relative-length units</em>), instead of <strong>pixels,</strong> which are <em>absolute-length units</em>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"788\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-2/week2-day2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1144,734\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week2 day2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-788\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=1144&#038;h=734\" alt=\"week2 day2\" width=\"1144\" height=\"734\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg 1144w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=96 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=192 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=493 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=657 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1144px) 100vw, 1144px\" /></p>\n<h4>Pixels, em and rem</h4>\n<p><strong>Pixels</strong> don&#8217;t traditionally change size based on their surroundings, although modern browsers can scale them when zoomed in, which in a matter-of-speaking changes their size, but doesn&#8217;t necessarily affect layout. The amount of real-estate they occupy on a screen also varies more, based on screen size.</p>\n<p>An <strong>em</strong> is a unit of measurement. Its basically the height of a character on a web page. I think the name is derived from the letter M on old metal printing blocks or printing presses. Ems can adjust their size to their surroundings, so they can scale if needed. 1em is equal to the height of whatever a medium character is in a browser, so from the start, they&#8217;re flexible and based on user settings.</p>\n<p>If a user goes into their browser&#8217;s settings and makes their font size larger, the em will adjust proportionally to the new font size. When coding, if a font-size is set to 10px, then 1em = 10px. Adjusting font size is then based on an em multiplier: like a heading might be 1.6em (16px) or 2.4em (24px).</p>\n<p>The issue with em is that its size is based on <strong>inheritance.</strong> So, if a parent object has text with a font-size of 1em, then the font-size on child objects will be based on that. Because font size is based on multipliers from the parent object, its harder to keep track of and maintain a consistent font-size throughout a page. If text is moved, the font size has to be adjusted.</p>\n<p><strong>Rem,</strong> or <em>root em</em> is like a centralized em. Its size is based on the user&#8217;s font settings, like an em, but the difference is that its based on a single size &#8211; either the size selected in the browser&#8217;s settings, or a size defined by the person who wrote the web page. It can be adjusted using a multiplier, just like an em, but since its based on a single, pre-defined font size, its infinitely easier to control. There&#8217;s no need to check em size on a per-paragraph or container basis. If we know that the base value is the user&#8217;s &#8220;medium&#8221; font size, or the web page&#8217;s pre-defined 16px, then that&#8217;s the rem&#8217;s base value for the entirety of the page or site. So, a 1.6rem or .75rem is the same throughout the page.</p>\n<p>Rem seems to have become the choice in controlling font size for reactive web pages, and after seeing how simple it is to implement and control them during this week&#8217;s projects, I can understand why. Also, apparently, although they&#8217;re new concepts to me, em and rem have been largely used in printing, typography and design for years now.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-and-using-rem-units-in-css/\">Sitepoint: Understanding and Using rem Units in CSS</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px\">Engage: EM vs REM vs PX – Why you shouldn&#8217;t “just use pixels”</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_790\" style=\"width: 1376px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-790\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"790\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-2/2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-790\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2-1\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2-1-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-790\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Britt walks us through using different measurement units in our CSS</p></div>\n<h4>Percentages and viewport size</h4>\n<p><strong>Percentages</strong> can also be used to control font sizes, but they&#8217;re more commonly used for responsive layout and scaling element and container sizes instead. For example, a &lt;div&gt; might have a width value set to 100% (width: 100%;) in CSS, which would allow it to stretch horizontally to either the left and right edges of the browser window, or the left and right sides of the element that contained it. Changing that to 90% would shave it in a little, letting it almost make it to full width. Changing it again to 50%, naturally, makes it half as wide as it can potentially be.</p>\n<p>With nested elements, percentages can become tricky. Its important to make sure that the total % width of sibling nested elements don&#8217;t exceed 100%, or the layout can break and horizontal scrolling might become necessary. I also had many experiences this week in which nested objects weren&#8217;t responding to width adjustments or Flexbox layout commands. This is because I was working on the elements themselves and not the parent elements, which were restricting the child elements growth (be aware, helicopter parents!).</p>\n<p>For example, if I have a &lt;section&gt; that has a 60% width, and in that section is a &lt;div&gt; with an image and a &lt;nav&gt; with 4-5 navigation items, and I try to give the &lt;div&gt; a width of 40% and the &lt;nav&gt; a width of 60%, we&#8217;d expect them to fill the parent &lt;section&gt; and give 40% of the width to the picture and 60% to the menu. I had crunched menus with no spacing several times and was trying to adjust the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;nav&gt; elements, and even the individual &lt;nav&gt; menu item widths, and horizontal justify properties in Flexbox, and other things. It turned out that I had to adjust the parent &lt;section&gt; to make it wider! It makes sense on hindsight, but at 3AM, the answer isn&#8217;t always evident.</p>\n<p>Its also important to keep minimum widths in mind, because %-based widths can, and will shrink down as much as needed, based on screen size. This means that people on small screens can find themselves squinting at a webpage with text or images that have become so small that they resemble desktop icons of themselves. Most people don&#8217;t like to read microdots.</p>\n<p><strong>vw</strong> and <strong>vh</strong> (viewport width and viewport height, respectively) rely on the size of the viewport (viewable area of the screen) to render webpages. They can be used anywhere other size units can, but we were cautioned to only make use of them in specific cases, like full-screen layout. I remember our instructor, Britt, using vw to make a border or margin element stretch across the entire screen, not just the 100% of the browser, minus the padding it reserved.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag\">Mozilla Developer Network: Using the viewport meta tag to control layout on mobile browsers</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some other units of measurement available as well, but we didn&#8217;t make use of them in our projects. w3schools has information about them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_units.asp\">w3schools: CSS Units</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_791\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-791\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"791\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-2/portfolio/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"800,658\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"portfolio\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=800\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-791\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=800&#038;h=658\" alt=\"portfolio\" width=\"800\" height=\"658\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg 800w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=150&amp;h=123 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=300&amp;h=247 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/portfolio.jpg?w=768&amp;h=632 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-791\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Portfolio project.

We had to examine the CSS and note where responsive units and media queries were used, update placeholder content and showcase projects we&#8217;ve worked on, including GitHub links. We also had to maintain proper attribution under the creative commons license, since the main designs weren&#8217;t our own. Then, we hosted the websites using <a href=\"https://pages.github.com/\"><strong>GitHub Pages</strong></a> and shared it for our cohort to see. It was a fun project that I&#8217;ll likely update as I go on with more content and (hopefully) more advanced coding and design. This blog is one of the links on my &#8220;Selected Works&#8221;. 😉</p>\n<p>We were also told that we could use sites like <a href=\"https://www.pexels.com/\"><strong>Pexels</strong></a> for free stock images. Other people shared more sites with free stock images as well. I cobbled together some images of my own, using my 20-year-old version of <strong>Photoshop.</strong> I hear Adobe has been working to force people to give up their local installations of their Adobe programs in favor of using their cloud solutions, but that&#8217;s probably a topic for another day.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s my portfolio website, on GitHub Pages: <strong><a href=\"https://vishalicious213.github.io/portfolio-website/\">Vish Singh &#8211; Portfolio Website</a></strong></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a long week.

Sprint Challenge on Friday, so I&#8217;ve made it to round two! Yesterday began the 2nd week of full-stack web development class for my cohort at Lambda School. With basic HTML and CSS still fresh on our minds, we&#8217;ve started working on <strong>responsive websites.</strong></p>\n<p>So, what is that, exactly? Responsive websites are basically sites that reconfigure themselves based on the screen size of the device that&#8217;s being used to view them. They might use one layout for a widescreen viewer, like a desktop monitor, and another for tablet view, and yet another for smartphone screens &#8211; maybe even multiple ones, dependent on the size of the phone screen.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"742\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/13/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-1/week2-day1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1130,683\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week2 day1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-742\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=1130&#038;h=683\" alt=\"week2 day1\" width=\"1130\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg 1130w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=91 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=181 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=464 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week2-day1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=619 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1130px) 100vw, 1130px\" /></p>\n<h3>Website layouts</h3>\n<p>There are 4 basic types of website layouts: <strong>fixed, fluid, adaptive</strong> and <strong>responsive</strong>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fixed layout</strong> websites were the norm in the early days of the internet. These websites were designed to work on desktop computer screens, but their layouts worsened as screens shrank. They were plagued by horizontal scrollbars and led to later tablet and mobile users having to pinch and zoom the screen to navigate &#8220;properly&#8221;. They&#8217;re somewhat cheaper to build than responsive websites, hence their continues (albeit decreased) presence today.\n<ul>\n<li>CSS widths are usually hard-coded into the website</li>\n<li>Horizontal scrollbars are the norm as smaller screens visit them</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Fluid layout</strong> websites were the first step towards responsiveness. They had the ability to expand and contract proportionately with the size of the screen being used to view them. It was an early fix, but had a major issue: without careful constraints images could get too small, buttons too large and layouts could spread apart with too much white space on desktops. It created a game of white space vs. content for designers to navigate. Fluid layouts are still used today, but less frequently than adaptive and responsive ones.\n<ul>\n<li>Design usually divided between desktop, tablet and phone</li>\n<li>Uses percentage-based units instead of hard-coded pixels</li>\n<li>Most/all of website designed to proportionally shrink</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive layout</strong> websites are an amalgamation of fixed and fluid designs. They make use of the speed of a fixed layout but are designed to accommodate different devices at pre-determined <strong>breakpoints</strong>. One example of this is using hard-coded pixels, instead of proportional resizing, but combining that with <strong>media queries</strong> so that the layout changes from one &#8220;fixed&#8221; layout to another based on screen size. Adaptive layouts are fairly quick to build, but their ability to more specifically accommodate many devices is limited due to their reliance on a small set of breakpoint designs.\n<ul>\n<li>Like with fluid, design often centers on desktop, tablet and mobile sizes</li>\n<li>Makes use of media queries, unlike fixed and fluid design</li>\n<li>Layout widths are still hard-coded with media queries</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Responsive layout</strong> websites combine aspects of all three design types that came before them, to create a more seamless experience for the viewer. They make use of media queries to constrain and <em>reconfigure</em> individual responsive units so that as the screen size shrinks or grows, functionality is preserved. Layouts can change with responsive websites, based on the size of the screen accessing them &#8211; sections can switch from horizontal to vertical, individual elements can become invisible, and more. They&#8217;re more costly to produce, with regard to time and effort, but have become the standard that long-term projects should be built with.\n<ul>\n<li>Design is usually divided between desktop, tablet and mobile</li>\n<li>Responsive units are employed</li>\n<li>Media queries are employed</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\t\t<style type=\"text/css\">\n\t\t\t#gallery-732-4 {\n\t\t\t\tmargin:

breakpoints</h3>\n<p>So, what are media queries and breakpoints?</p>\n<p><strong>CSS breakpoints</strong> are blocks of CSS code that change the layout or properties of elements on a web page based on the size of the screen viewing them. This screen size is called a <strong>viewport</strong>. A CSS breakpoint can look like this, and can have as much or as little CSS code nested inside of it as needed to make necessary adjustments to the website based on its trigger (usually screen width):</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<pre>@media (max-width: 500px) {\n    header {\n        flex-direction: column-reverse;\n        text-align: center;\n        justify-content: space-between;\n    }\n}</pre>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>They&#8217;re apparently also referred to as media query breakpoints, which leads to our next item:</p>\n<p>A <strong>media query</strong> is a CSS command that checks the device viewing a web page for certain criteria that can then be used to initiate breakpoint code. Media queries can check for viewport height and width, device height and width, device orientation (landscape/portrait), and even screen resolution. It essentially provides the trigger to activate a breakpoint and reconfigure a web page.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/layout/css-breakpoints-responsive-design-how-to/\">How to use CSS breakpoints to create responsive designs</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp\">w3schools: Responsive Web Design &#8211; Media Queries</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp\">w3schools: How TO &#8211; Typical Device Breakpoints</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/\">css tricks: Media Queries for Standard Devices</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>One other topic we covered in class was <strong>mobile-first design</strong> vs. <strong>desktop-first design</strong>, which affects how breakpoints and initial layout is determined. The first essentially designs for a small screen and adds elements (and width) as screen size increases. The latter is the opposite, starting from a widescreen base and reconfiguring the screen as it narrows. Its the norm for how desktop web applications are built (including where I work &#8211; all of my design was desktop-first&#8230; it was actually desktop-only!).</p>\n<h3>Project</h3>\n<p>I actually completed MVP (minimum viable product) for yesterday&#8217;s project on time, and then I started the first stretch goal. I didn&#8217;t finish the stretch goal until later in the night though, because I had to leave and make dinner for the kids and be a dad.</p>\n<p>We took the website we worked on last week (the Great Ideas website) and made it responsive. When we first created the website, it used basic html and CSS and a lot of inline-blocks. Then, we graduated to Flexbox. Yesterday, we took the Flexbox versions, which were desktop-first designs, and then added breakpoints at 800px for tablet viewing and 500px for mobile devices. Here are my final layouts:</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/13\\/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-1\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

I can recall concepts a little more surely, and I&#8217;m beginning to get used to Git Bash and GitHub, mainly through repeated use.</p>\n<p>The first stretch goal for our project was to create a responsive version of our Services page. Creating the Services page was a stretch goal from one of last week&#8217;s projects, which I had completed after-hours, so I was able to use it for yesterday&#8217;s work. Like the Index page, it made use of breakpoints at 800px (tablet) and 500px (mobile).</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/13\\/lambda-school-full-stack-week-2-day-1\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px;

School: Full Stack &#8211; Week 1, Day 5: Sprint Challenge","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-5-sprint-challenge/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-br","content":"<p>So, Friday was the day I&#8217;d been nervous about. It was our first sprint challenge at Lambda School. Its essentially a 3-hour, timed project that assesses whether or not we&#8217;ve retained what we were taught during the week and are able to recall and make use of it quickly enough to complete a task in the allotted time.</p>\n<p>A lot of people breezed through the challenge. I wasn&#8217;t one of them. I was working on CSS code right down to the time limit. I managed to complete the challenge (or so I thought) but I didn&#8217;t get to any of the additional stretch goals.</p>\n<p>This first challenge had three components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Type out answers to 5 questions about html, css, the box model and git</li>\n<li>Complete a 2-page coding project that focused on html and css</li>\n<li>Make commits and a pull request to our team lead using Git Bash and GitHub</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Self-study questions</h3>\n<p>So, answering the 5 self-study questions wasn&#8217;t too difficult for me. We did have to edit the markdown file on our fork of the GitHub repository for the project and type our answers there though. Doing so also forced us to make sure we knew how to fork the repository, clone and edit it on our computer using VS Code, make edits to the readme.md file and then use Git Bash to upload it back to Git Hub. Once we had that process down, we had to also add our team lead as a contributor, for grading, and make a pull request so the TL could access the fork. I was able to do this all fairly quickly, which left me with a good chunk of our 3-hour time to focus on coding the project.</p>\n<h3>Minimum Viable Product</h3>\n<p>The MVP was the bulk of our challenge. We were given two html pages with accompanying css. The first page was mostly set up, but we had to make changes to it. We had to add elements that were missing &#8211; like a navigation bar, images and links &#8211; after referencing a design document. It was a PNG file that showed what the completed homepage should look like. There was also a middle section of the page that contained 10 black boxes which we had to modify so that they each displayed pre-selected colors from a list.</p>\n<p>I was able to complete this part of the challenge fairly quickly. It was similar to other projects that we&#8217;d worked on during the week. For the colorization, I used html IDs, which we&#8217;d learned about early in the week, and even used in some exercises, but which I, personally, hadn&#8217;t used in any projects since. I think it took me about 30 mins or so, and I was happy with the result. It was a spot-on reproduction of what was given to us in the design document.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_714\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-714\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"714\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-5-sprint-challenge/sprint-challenge-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1125,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sprint challenge 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-714\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=1125&#038;h=980\" alt=\"sprint challenge 1\" width=\"1125\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg 1125w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=261 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=669 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=892 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-714\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Page 1 of our first Sprint Challenge</p></div>\n<p>The second page is what took up the bulk of my time. We were tasked to mark-up and style an About page using a design document (another PNG) as a reference. We had to add a header and navigation, certain links and mirror the design that we&#8217;d been given using html and css.</p>\n<p>I learned something while working on the second page: <em>using someone else&#8217;s mark-up can be hard</em>. It doesn&#8217;t necessarily conform to how I think. Their way of dividing the page wasn&#8217;t necessarily how I&#8217;d do it. They used virtually no semantic html &#8211; I remember a lot of &lt;div&gt; tags with no context. This spilled over into the css, because classes that were created in html were called in the css and weren&#8217;t necessarily what I&#8217;d have chosen.</p>\n<p>I had a hard time filtering through the code and making it work in a way that made sense to me. The first big problem was that almost all of the content in the page was grouped together. After quite some time running through it, back and forth, and trying to style certain sections, I was able to divide the main content into smaller parts that I could style more individually. I had to do this because there were parts that were divided by images, and by horizontal lines, which needed different styling from the main text.</p>\n<p>It took some trial-and-error, and although this part of the project strongly resembled sections of the Flexbox project we&#8217;d worked on during Day 3, it was made much more difficult for me because I hadn&#8217;t come up with the individual tags to section-out the page, and I didn&#8217;t necessarily want to break the existing css, which relied on the provided html and structure.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_720\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-720\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"720\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-5-sprint-challenge/sprint-challenge-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1125,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"sprint challenge 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-720\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=1125&#038;h=980\" alt=\"sprint challenge 2\" width=\"1125\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg 1125w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=261 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=669 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sprint-challenge-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=892 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-720\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Page 2 of our first Sprint Challenge</p></div>\n<h3>Submission and review</h3>\n<p>After taking the entire three hours to format the page to my liking and make it as close to the design document as I could, I pushed it to GitHub using Git Bash. I had already created a pull request earlier, after I had answered the self-study questions, so our team lead would see all of the pushes and commits I&#8217;d made to GitHub and assess the most-recent version for grading purposes.</p>\n<p>I joined the Slack channel for our group after submitting. I saw that some people in my group had breezed through the challenge and  enjoyed it &#8211; one person said it was fun! Several were surprised at how well it had gone for them. I commented that I was worried, because I&#8217;d just barely made MVP by the time limit.</p>\n<p>Reed, our team lead, then took some time to go through each of our pull requests and give us an initial evaluation. He didn&#8217;t do this on Slack, of course, because of confidentiality concerns, so he initiated a Zoom session with each of us, individually, as he finished reviewing each submission. I think maybe 3 hours passed before he got to mine.</p>\n<p>We spoke about the experience and I told him that I thought I&#8217;d completed MVP, but I was concerned because I was slow. He had me open my local copy of the project in VS Code and we went through it together. We examined the code in the editor and the output in Chrome. We also used Chrome&#8217;s Inspector to look at select elements in the browser, to see how elements were grouped or styled.</p>\n<p>It turned out, I actually hadn&#8217;t met MVP, but I was close. I was able to answer questions from Reed that demonstrated that I had a good understanding of why certain elements weren&#8217;t exactly like the design document&#8217;s version. Some of it had to do with my reverse-engineering the provided html. This had been a huge slow-down for me. When I repositioned the starting or ending points of certain &lt;div&gt; elements, I had inadvertently left a piece of the page out. This had a big effect that I didn&#8217;t catch &#8211; it was in the footer &#8211; because that main &lt;div&gt; had some associated css that styled it in a way that was crucial to how each &lt;div&gt; on the page was supposed to appear.</p>\n<p>Reed thought that maybe I had forgotten to style the footer, or maybe something else (I can&#8217;t remember the other thought) but I was able to quickly explain what had gone wrong to him, and later on, I corrected it in the code. The footer explanation was part of a series of such that helped him to determine that I had a good conceptual grasp of how the page worked and how it was supposed to function using the html and css.</p>\n<p>Another detail that I missed was small size differentiations between parts of the bodies of text. There were elements that made use of the entire allocated width of the page, and there were elements that made use of only some of it. So, I had to alter certain width properties in css and use Flexbox properties to correctly align them. I was able to do this as well, afterward, but I felt bad that I&#8217;d missed it in my rush to complete the page.</p>\n<p>There were also horizontal lines (horizontal rule, or &lt;hr&gt;, in html) that I had placed slightly imperfectly. One was supposed to span the width of the page, but others were only as wide as their individual flexed containers. They all had to conform to proper alignment as well.</p>\n<p>In the end, I adjusted those as well. It was after the official submission, so I don&#8217;t know if it counted, but at least my final commits could show that I understood enough to correctly duplicate the page based on the design document. I was able to add rounded corners to &#8220;buttons&#8221; as well that changed color when moused-over. I did this using <strong>hover,</strong> which we had gone over earlier in the week, and with <strong>border-radius</strong>, which I&#8217;d picked up on my own. I really like the combination of the two to style buttons.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get to attempt any of the stretch goals, which included topics we hadn&#8217;t yet covered in class, but I expect we&#8217;ll see this week. These included:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding a new page from one given in the navigation bar, including coming up with content and images for it</li>\n<li>Introducing css animations to the site, which I also haven&#8217;t learned yet</li>\n<li>Building a contact page with a form that includes any inputs we choose</li>\n<li>Adding responsive breakpoints using media queries</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Afterword</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had some thoughts about how I&#8217;d approach the project again, if I had to do it, and one of the big ones is that I think I wouldn&#8217;t have just jumped in and tried to modify the code after reviewing it. I think I&#8217;d have been better-off if I printed the design document or sketched it out and generally plotted out how I&#8217;d want to section-off elements on the page and what specific formatting options I&#8217;d use to place them where they need to go &#8211; especially which Flexbox options I&#8217;d use for each section, and what css I&#8217;d use to further refine elements after they&#8217;d been positioned by Flexbox.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve been blogging through this a lot, and it takes quite some time, but I also need to do some of these projects and challenges over again, to get more practice and really ingrain how to use certain formatting tools in my head. Hopefully, this (and sketching out a general wireframe for each page) will increase my implementation speed, because I&#8217;m now convinced that I&#8217;m the slowest person in my group.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, Friday was the day I&#8217;d been nervous about.

School: Full Stack &#8211; Week 1, Day 4","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-4/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-b7","content":"<p>On Day 4 at Lambda School, we covered <strong><a href=\"https://git-scm.com/\">git</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/\">GitHub</a></strong>, which are both technologies that are new to me. I was aware that GitHub was used for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control\"><strong>version control</strong></a> in some way, but I never knew the details about it. We were actually called on to use GitHub earlier in the course &#8211; I can&#8217;t remember if it was from Day 1, or if it was later, but our instructor, Britt, explained that they knew it was an issue in the program that we&#8217;re supposed to use it to submit work, but it isn&#8217;t fully-covered until Day 4 of the course.</p>\n<h3>git</h3>\n<p>Ok, so in a nutshell, git is version control software that was created by <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds\">Linus Torvalds</a></strong>, the same person who invented <strong>Linux</strong>. Its main purpose is to allow code to be copied, modified, and then (after error-testing), combined back into the main code that it was copied from. These ideas are called <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)\">forking</a></strong> (copying the master code), <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(version_control)\">branching</a></strong> (making modifications to that code so it now differs from the original) and <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_(version_control)\">merging</a></strong> (combining the new code and original code into a new master code).</p>\n<p>git (yeah, its all lowercase, so starting sentences new paragraphs with it looks wrong) has the ability to compare code and track its changes, so it knows specifically what lines in code were newly added and what lined of old code were removed, and what lines were altered in some way. This can be viewed by people who review code before its merged into the master code, so they know what changes were made.</p>\n<p>git allows multiple developers to work together on the same project, simultaneously, without severely impacting each other. Its safest when they&#8217;re working on different things, like different functions or modules, or at the very least different sections of the same code. For example, if a team was making a game, maybe a platformer, like Mario Bros. or Sonic the Hedgehog, one team might be working on a certain level in the game, and another team could be working on a different level; or maybe one team is working on making the character run and another is working on jumping; or one team is adding water effects that will be applied to all areas with water, and another team is animating enemies or modifying their AI. All of these things could be happening at the same time, with multiple teams each tackling one of them. They would all have their own fork of the master code, and when their respective parts of the code were in a complete enough state to be made available for testing, they could create a <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control#Pull_requests\">pull request</a></strong>, which is basically a flag that alerts people who they specify when they create their branch, that lets reviewers know that the code is ready for review, and if it passes, can be merged into the master branch.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_706\" style=\"width: 1060px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-706\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"706\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-4/week1-day4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1050,822\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week1 day4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-706\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=1050&#038;h=822\" alt=\"week1 day4\" width=\"1050\" height=\"822\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg 1050w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=300&amp;h=235 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=768&amp;h=601 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day4.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=802 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-706\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Week 1, Day 4</p></div>\n<h3>GitHub</h3>\n<p>GitHub, on the other hand, is firstly NOT git. Its a separate entity and it offers what&#8217;s essentially cloud storage and a GUI for using git. There are other services like GitHub &#8211; for example, <strong><a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/\">GitLab</a></strong> and <strong><a href=\"https://bitbucket.org/product/\">Bitbucket</a>,</strong> but GitHub has been around longer and has a much larger userbase. Apparently, its very widely-used by developers to build programming portfolios that can be shown to prospective employers and is a large presence in the open-source community for sharing projects for collaboration.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_701\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-701\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"701\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-4/github-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1125,538\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"GitHub\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-701\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=1125&#038;h=538\" alt=\"GitHub\" width=\"1125\" height=\"538\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg 1125w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=72 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=143 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=367 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/github-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=490 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">GitHub, with my updates as of this writing</p></div>\n<h3>Git Bash</h3>\n<p>Although there are GUIs available for using git, the most common way of using it is apparently through the command line. The command line terminal that we use at Lambda School is <strong><a href=\"https://gitforwindows.org/\">Git Bash</a></strong>. I used to be very comfortable with MS-DOS, back in the late 80s and throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, but its been a long time since I&#8217;ve really used it. Git Bash is similar to the DOS terminal, but I think its Linux-based. Its commands are different. For example, I&#8217;m used to typing [dir] to list the contents of a directory, but in Git Bash, the command is [ls] for list. [cd] changes directories, and when combined with back-slashes or dots, we can move across multiple directories &#8211; using Git Bash, those flags behave differently from what I&#8217;m used to.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_614\" style=\"width: 605px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-614\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"614\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/07/simplified-git-instructions-for-lambda-school-students/git_upload/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"595,656\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"git_upload\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=272\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=595\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-614\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=595&#038;h=656\" alt=\"git_upload\" width=\"595\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg 595w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=136&amp;h=150 136w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=272&amp;h=300 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-614\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Git Bash</p></div>\n<h3>Process</h3>\n<p>When we work on projects at Lambda, we generally fork them from existing <strong>repositories</strong> on GitHub. Repositories are saved codebases on GitHub. That copies the code from Lambda&#8217;s account into our personal GitHub account. Then we can branch it and modify it to do whatever the project&#8217;s instructions ask us to do. This way, we&#8217;re working on a branch of our copy of the master code, so if we need to revert back to the master for any reason, we can.</p>\n<p>We have to add our team lead as a <strong>collaborator,</strong> so he or she can review our code. They get alerted that we&#8217;re ready for a code review when we create a pull request for this purpose. Once they review any code we&#8217;ve branched, if it meets <strong>MVP</strong> (minimum viable product) or whatever the project&#8217;s requirements were, they can then merge it into our forked copy of the master code, and we&#8217;re assigned a grade for completion of the project (1 = didn&#8217;t meet MVP, 2 = met MVP, 3 = exceeded MVP by completing at least one <em>stretch goal</em>).</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_700\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-700\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"700\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/11/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-4/day4-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"day4-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-700\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"day4-1\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day4-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-700\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Learning to use git via the command line</p></div>\n<p>There&#8217;s more to git and GitHub, and I know we&#8217;re using it at a basic level right now.

They mainly add to the IDE&#8217;s highlighting of code so that its easier to follow start and end points for nested elements and also do things like quickly visualize nesting level.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s what he shared, along with snippets of their descriptions:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vincaslt.highlight-matching-tag\">Highlight Matching Tag</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>This extension is intended to provide the missing functionality that should be built-in out of the box in VSCode &#8211; to highlight matching opening or closing tags. Optionally it also shows path to tag in the status bar.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Even though VSCode has implemented some basic matching recently, it&#8217;s just that &#8211; basic. The built-in functionality is to match only from tag name and only for some file extensions. This extension will try to match from anywhere: tag attributes, from inside strings, any file, while also providing extensive styling options to customize how tags are highlighted.</em></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"https://images2.imgbox.com/71/2a/zIA1XCzK_o.gif\" /></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer-2\">Bracket Pair Colorizer 2</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>This extension allows matching brackets to be identified with colours. The user can define which tokens to match, and which colours to use.</em></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"https://github.com/CoenraadS/Bracket-Pair-Colorizer-2/raw/master/images/example.png\" /></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oderwat.indent-rainbow\">Indent-Rainbow</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>A simple extension to make indentation more readable</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>This extension colorizes the indentation in front of your text alternating four different colors on each step. Some may find it helpful in writing code for Nim or Python.</em></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oderwat/vscode-indent-rainbow/master/assets/example.png\" /></p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker\">Code Spell Checker</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>A basic spell checker that works well with camelCase code.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>The goal of this spell checker is to help catch common spelling errors while keeping the number of false positives low.</em></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetsidesoftware/vscode-spell-checker/master/packages/client/images/suggestions.gif\" /></p>\n<p>In addition to what Reed shared (I&#8217;ve been using all of them), some people in the Slack also suggested the following two extensions:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradgashler.htmltagwrap\">htmltagwrap</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Wraps your selection in HTML tags. Can wrap inline selections and selections that span multiple lines (works with both single selections and multiple selections at once).</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>To use, select one or many chunks of code and press &#8220;<strong>Alt + W</strong>&#8221; (&#8220;<strong>Option + W</strong>&#8221; for Mac).</em></p>\n<p><img style=\"max-width:100%;\" src=\"https://github.com/bgashler1/vscode-htmltagwrap/raw/master/images/screenshot.gif\" /></p>\n<p>This last one is a Chrome extension, not a VS Code one:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pesticide-for-chrome/bblbgcheenepgnnajgfpiicnbbdmmooh?hl=en-US\">Pesticide for Chrome</a></h4>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>This extension inserts the Pesticide CSS into the current page, outlining each element to better see placement on the page.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In this version the banner at the bottom is off by default. To turn it on hold the control key. Be sure that you&#8217;ve &#8220;clicked&#8221; into the window otherwise the browser won&#8217;t be able to tell that you&#8217;re typing (that&#8217;s just how browsers work).</em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Earlier this week, Reed, our team lead, showed us some extensions for VS Code that he uses and which he thought would be helpful for us.

School for me. On Day 2, our project was to build a website with provided assets using semantic html and CSS. We used <strong>inline-block</strong> a lot and some absolute and relative positioning to do a lot of the styling work. It was a tedious process, and I didn&#8217;t actually complete the project.</p>\n<p>This changed a bit for the better on Day 3. We were introduced to the <strong>Flexbox</strong> module, and if I weren&#8217;t already bald, it might have saved some hair on my head. The module is called using the display keyword in CSS:</p>\n<pre>display: flex;</pre>\n<p>Once invoked, it unlocks a suite of formatting options that allow groups of elements to be formatted at once with single commands that might have otherwise taken lines of code to duplicate. Its the anti-inline-block.</p>\n<p>Flexbox is called on a parent element and then it works its magic on the children elements. It only works one generation down though, so grandchildren and other elements that are further nested are unaffected. The parent is called a <strong>flex container</strong> and the children are <strong>flex items.</strong> It allows elements to be arranged based on an X and Y axis, called the <strong>main axis</strong> and <strong>cross axis</strong>, respectively. So, the main axis runs horizontally (left/right) and the cross axis runs vertically (up/down).</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_646\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-646\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"646\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/10/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-3/project2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1125,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"project2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-646\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=1125&#038;h=980\" alt=\"project2\" width=\"1125\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg 1125w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=261 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=669 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=892 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-646\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Day 3 refactor of Day 2&#8217;s website using Flexbox</p></div>\n<p>Some of the things that can be done with Flexbox include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Changing the default flow direction of elements from horizontal to vertical</li>\n<li>Changing flow direction from left-right to right-left</li>\n<li>Changing flow direction to up-down or down-up</li>\n<li>Causing elements to &#8220;wrap&#8221; to multiple lines instead of trying to all flow on one long line</li>\n<li>Causing elements to &#8220;wrap&#8221; in reverse</li>\n<li>Justifying content to start on the left, the right or centered</li>\n<li>Evenly-distributing elements on a line (stretching them across the entire line)</li>\n<li>Evenly-distributing elements on a line with equal space around them, or between them</li>\n<li>Aligning items along the Y-axis so they stretch to fill the container they&#8217;re in or they line up in columns either starting from the top or bottom of a container, or they do that same thing in the center of a container &#8211; either evenly distributed or in accordance with their baselines</li>\n<li>Doing all of that stuff from the last bullet horizontally instead of vertically</li>\n<li>Manipulating the order that elements are laid out in a container based on a weighted number assigned to each element</li>\n<li>Grow or shrink an item (or items) in a flex container so it takes up more or less space</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are some more functions, but I didn&#8217;t explore all of them.

Basically, we took our old html and used it as the basis for the new project. We changed all of the css to move from using inline-block to Flexbox. It was amazing. Although it took me some time to complete, I was able to finish the entire project, and even add in some small touches of my own.</p>\n<p>The lines of css code on Day 3 was significantly less than on Day 2, because Flexbox handled a lot of grouping and positioning with single lines that would have taken several each using the css that we&#8217;d learned earlier in the week.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_647\" style=\"width: 1135px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-647\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"647\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/10/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-3/project2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1125,980\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"project2-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-647\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=1125&#038;h=980\" alt=\"project2-2\" width=\"1125\" height=\"980\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg 1125w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=131 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=261 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=669 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project2-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=892 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1125px) 100vw, 1125px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-647\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">2nd page of Day 3 project.

I understand the concepts that we&#8217;re learning, although I&#8217;m still slow in implementing them. I think I know how to proceed going forward though: I think I need to map out parts of the web pages that I&#8217;m building on paper so I can layout which Flexbox controls I need for different sections on a page. Its basically paper-prototyping, but for some of it, I&#8217;ll be reverse-engineering existing html and css.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, Wednesday was Day 3 at Lambda School for me.

EST. In 3 hours, my first Sprint Challenge will happen, and I&#8217;m a little nervous. If I make it through the Challenge, then I&#8217;ll have successfully completed my first week at Lambda School.</p>\n<p>So, a Sprint Challenge is a timed project that we have to complete in order to validate that we&#8217;ve understood the concepts that were taught during the week. Its 3 hours long and we&#8217;re not allowed to communicate with other students or our instructors, team leads, and so on for help. We are allowed to reference our notes, projects, Lambda material and even the whole internet and any other resources we have available (like books &#8211; remember those? I do, my wife&#8217;s a librarian.).</p>\n<p>Ok, so regarding the week&#8230; I&#8217;m slow. I haven&#8217;t checked strongly against the other people in my team (I think cohort means the entire group of 100+ of us, so I&#8217;ll refer to the smaller group I&#8217;m in as my team) but I&#8217;m fairly certain that I&#8217;m the slowest of the bunch. I haven&#8217;t completed any of the daily projects on the day that they were assigned. They tend to take me 2 days. I think others (or maybe even everyone else) are completing them in a matter of hours and submitting them. I also don&#8217;t remember terminology for everything that we&#8217;ve learned. I get concepts, but the specific words used to define these concepts have eluded me every time I&#8217;ve had a 1-on-1 Zoom session with Reed, our team lead. I think that&#8217;s just because this is all new to me, and I hope I&#8217;m not just too thick to remember basic terminology.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve learned a lot though. I know some semantic HTML, some CSS (including Flexbox, which I really like) and I know enough to know that I don&#8217;t know git very well. Here are some thoughts about the week:</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_620\" style=\"width: 1060px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-620\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"620\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/week1-day1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1050,704\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week1 day1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-620\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=1050&#038;h=704\" alt=\"week1 day1\" width=\"1050\" height=\"704\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg 1050w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=101 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=201 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=515 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=687 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-620\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Week 1, Day 1</p></div>\n<p>I went over my Day 1 experience in this post, so we&#8217;ll move on to the following day:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/\">Lambda School: Full Stack &#8211; Week 1, Day 1</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Day 2</h3>\n<p>The 2nd day of class introduced us to the <strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/06/styling-the-box-model-with-css/\">Box Model</a></strong> and to <strong>CSS</strong>. The box model is a concept that describes how elements on a web page are individually laid out. In a nutshell, every element (block of text, picture, etc.) on a web page is hung like a picture frame. The actual content is called <strong>&#8220;content&#8221;</strong> and is essentially in the middle of a box. This is the text we read or the images that we look at. Surrounding that is a field of white space called <strong>padding.</strong> This very much resembles the white backing a picture is placed on when its framed. A lot of the time, some of that background material can be seen around the edges of the picture, surrounding it. Padding can be manipulated &#8211; its color can be changed and it can be thickened or thinned, essentially giving the content more or less space to itself inside of the &#8220;box&#8221;.</p>\n<p>A <strong>border</strong> frames the padding and is essentially the picture frame of the image. In real life, these can be simple lines of plastic, metal or wood or they can be ornate and rival, contrast or accentuate the picture that they&#8217;re holding in containment. On a computer, something similar is possible &#8211; margins can be styled to take on many different appearances, from solid lines to dashed or dotted lines, double-lines and more. Their thickness and color can be modified, and there are probably other ways to manipulate their appearance that I haven&#8217;t learned yet.</p>\n<p>Finally, we have the <strong>margin</strong>. Margins are similar to the lines on the left and right side of notebook paper. We&#8217;re not supposed to write in that space, normally. It&#8217;s used to visually push away from the edges of the paper so we can really focus our attention on what&#8217;s in-between. Its like white space. Margins, on a web page, are invisible. They have no color, only space. They act as buffers against other elements on a page &#8211; kind of like personal space. Like padding, their size can be increased or decreased, but we don&#8217;t actually see margins, we only see the border (if visible) and content inside of them, and the other elements (or space) around them. Its like air &#8211; we know its present, and we can discern its effects, but we don&#8217;t actually see it.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_633\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-633\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"633\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/day2-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"day2-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-633\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"day2-1\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-1-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-633\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Manipulating elements using the box model</p></div>\n<p>We spent some time on Day 2 manipulating the box model around text. We saw how a basic html element, like a &lt;div&gt; could have its appearance altered by changing properties of the box, like changing its background color (and the text color of the content, but that&#8217;s technically not part of the &#8220;box&#8221;) and manipulating the content area&#8217;s space by specific pixel sizes. We adjusted the height and width of padding and the margin and manipulated the border&#8217;s width, style and color.</p>\n<p>There were programming challenges we had to complete, like creating 4 boxes using html and changing their appearance and seeing how they interacted with each other. We then moved on to basic CSS.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_629\" style=\"width: 1060px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-629\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"629\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/week1-day2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1050,764\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"week1 day2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-629\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=1050&#038;h=764\" alt=\"week1 day2.jpg\" width=\"1050\" height=\"764\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg 1050w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=109 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=218 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=559 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/week1-day2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=745 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-629\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Week 1, Day 2</p></div>\n<h3>CSS</h3>\n<p>With some basic html under our belts, we began to explore how to manipulate the appearance and behavior of page elements using <strong>CSS,</strong> or Cascading Style Sheets. We looked at the <strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/pr_class_display.asp\">display:</a></strong> property, which comes with a suite of options that can be used to <em>style</em> elements on a web page. Some of the more simple options we tried were <strong>none, inline, block</strong> and <strong>inline-block</strong>.</p>\n<p>We also learned what a <strong>CSS Reset</strong> is. Its basically a set of CSS style properties that remove the default styling from a web browser. This is done because different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Edge, IE, Firefox, etc.) render web pages a little differently because they&#8217;re set up to automatically apply styles to web pages in ways specific to the given browser. A CSS reset clears away this browser-supplied styling so that web pages rely only on the styling that was provided with the page. This helps to ensure that pages look and behave the same across different browsers.</p>\n<p>There are different CSS resets available online. The one that we used in our projects is an <a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/\"><strong>open-source reset</strong></a> from <strong><a href=\"https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/\">Eric Meyer</a></strong>. I think most resets are open-source and publicly available. Some companies have specific, proprietary resets that they use in-house.</p>\n<p>An alternative to CSS resets that&#8217;s widely used is called <strong><a href=\"https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/\">Normalize</a></strong>. Normalize corrects cross-browser issues to make them behave similarly and allows a programmer to add his/her own styles. During Day 2, we looked at a web page, then applied Meyer&#8217;s reset to it and noted the differences, and the normalized it and contrasted the changes with both the base render and the reset. We&#8217;ve since been using Meyer&#8217;s reset in all of our projects this week. Its freely-available on the web to all who want to use it, as are others.</p>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_634\" style=\"width: 1690px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-634\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"634\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/day2-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"day2-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-634\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"day2-2\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/day2-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-634\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Learning about absolute and relative positioning</p></div>\n<h3>Project</h3>\n<p>At the end of each day, we have a project that needs to be worked on. It should be completed after the morning lecture (and lunch) and submitted by the end of the day using git, but we can keep working on it afterward if desired (which I&#8217;ve been doing, because I&#8217;m slow and haven&#8217;t completed any project in the given time frame yet).</p>\n<p>The 2nd day&#8217;s project was to build a web page using a design file that was given to us. The design file was a jpg of a web page. We were given html and a CSS page with reset code at the top of it. We were tasked to use <strong>inline-block</strong> layout techniques and the box model (content, padding, margin, border) to layout the page, and any CSS that we wanted &#8211; except we couldn&#8217;t use modules like Flexbox, which we&#8217;d explore on Day 3.</p>\n<p>If we were able to complete the project quickly, there were additional <em>stretch goals</em> that we could attempt:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give the navigation a background color and have it fixed to the top of the page so it scrolls with the user</li>\n<li>Introduce a new font family from Google fonts</li>\n<li>Build a new page based off of a navigation item &#8211; lay it out using the box model and display: inline-block, like we did with the first page</li>\n<li>Change all the image tags into background images</li>\n<li>Research CSS animations and implement ideas when hovering over buttons or navigation items</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_630\" style=\"width: 1060px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-630\" loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"630\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/project1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1050,937\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"project1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-630\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=1050&#038;h=937\" alt=\"project1\" width=\"1050\" height=\"937\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg 1050w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=134 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=268 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=685 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/project1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=914 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-630\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">My unfinished first project</p></div>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t do any of the stretch goals. I didn&#8217;t actually successfully complete the first project. I did enough that I was able to demonstrate understanding of the material, but inline-block is tedious to work with and I&#8217;m slow. Apparently, part of the reason we were forced to use it was to contrast with the upcoming Flexbox CSS that we&#8217;d learn on Day 3. It was also to help us learn how CSS runs &#8220;under the hood&#8221;.</p>\n<p>I can&#8217;t go into detail, but every day of the week there were video tutorials that we watched, articles were linked in the training kit for us to read and we had our 2-hour live <strong>Zoom</strong> lecture at the beginning of class. During the day, we were able to use <strong>Slack</strong> to speak with other students in our team or the general cohort for help &#8211; this included team leads, student leads and available teachers. I didn&#8217;t do a lot of this, but I read through a bit of what others were posting, which was helpful.</p>\n<p>Sometime in the afternoon, our TL checked in with us via Zoom to see how we were doing, and at the end of the day, we had a Zoom meeting with our team and went over the day&#8217;s experience. Over the past few days, this led to extended Zoom sessions to clarify topics with our TL. Some students Zoomed with each other, to work together and even to do <em>pair programming</em>. Its a very supportive environment.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve had some technical issues over the week. The camera on my desktop has been crashing the computer, causing the infamous <strong>Blue Screen of Death</strong> (BSOD). Its happened 4 times over the past 3 days. Over the weekend, I&#8217;m going to try to find an alternative to using it. I couldn&#8217;t find updated drivers for the camera, and when I &#8220;updated&#8221; the video card drivers, it actually reverted to an older version.</p>\n<p>Ok&#8230; I&#8217;m going to shower and review material to prep for today&#8217;s Sprint Challenge. Oh, and I joined <strong>Twitter</strong> earlier this week &#8211; mainly to see Lambda stuff and occasionally post about this blog. I replied to someone&#8217;s tweet about being 43 and feeling like he was too old to apply to Lambda, and <strong>Austin Allred</strong>, the CEO and founder of Lambda, liked my tweet! It was my first like! 😉</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"631\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/09/lambda-school-full-stack-week-1-day-2/twitter-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"600,555\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"twitter-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg?w=600\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-631\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg?w=600&#038;h=555\" alt=\"twitter-1\" width=\"600\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg 600w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=139 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/twitter-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=278 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its 7:45 in the AM, EST.

understanding of how to use GitHub is incomplete. I&#8217;ve had exactly 1 day&#8217;s worth of experience with it, but this might be useful to people with even less experience than what I have. Tomorrow, the focus of the class is GitHub, so if there&#8217;s time, I&#8217;ll post again with better information.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m new to git. I don&#8217;t think that I used it properly to submit a project yesterday, but after reviewing a video from <strong>BigKnell,</strong> at Lambda School, I just went through the following processes and they worked. Yesterday, I went through procedure 1 (<em>To get a project from GitHub</em>) to fork a project to my GitHub account and then download a local copy onto my computer. I repeated the process earlier for today&#8217;s project. Both times, I was successful.</p>\n<p>Earlier today, I uploaded yesterday&#8217;s project to GitHub using procedure 2 (<em>To upload an existing project from your computer onto GitHub</em>). I didn&#8217;t do this correctly yesterday &#8211; I was too worn out and tried to use the web interface to move documents, which isn&#8217;t correct. Today&#8217;s upload was successful.</p>\n<p>I have to properly try the 3rd procedure (<em>To submit a pull request</em>), which submits a pull request to GitHub. I need to understand it better, but for now, if you&#8217;re stuck on how to copy a project to your GitHub account and then download it onto your computer, and then upload your changes to GitHub, the first 2 procedures work.</p>\n<h4>To get a project from GitHub:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to the project page and <strong>fork</strong> the project to your account (the fork button is on the top-right, forking makes a copy of the project and places it in your online GitHub account)</li>\n<li>Click on the green &#8220;<strong>Clone or Download</strong>&#8221; button.\n<ol>\n<li>Make sure &#8220;Clone with HTTPS&#8221; is at the top of the dialogue box that opens</li>\n<li>Click on the clipboard icon to copy the project URL to your clipboard</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Open <strong>Git Bash</strong>, or whatever terminal (command line) program you use on your local computer</li>\n<li>Navigate to the directory/folder where you keep your projects (you might need to Google this, since instructions might be different depending on your terminal program)\n<ol>\n<li>I use Git Bash. My projects are in a folder called &#8220;git&#8221; inside of &#8220;My Documents&#8221; on my Windows computer</li>\n<li>I got there by typing &#8220;cd&#8221; to change directories to the root directory, then I typed &#8220;ls&#8221; to list the folders there and saw My Documents. I typed &#8220;cd &#8220;my documents&#8221;&#8221; (&#8220;my documents&#8221; has to be in quotes since there&#8217;s a space between words) to go to My Documents and then &#8220;cd git&#8221; to go to the git subfolder.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Type &#8220;<strong>git clone</strong>&#8220;, a space, and then right-click and paste the URL that was copied in step 2 (the URL of the project from GitHub).\n<ol>\n<li>This will cause the terminal to copy the project&#8217;s files from GitHub onto your computer.</li>\n<li>We&#8217;re in the root directory of wherever you have your projects. It will create a folder for the project, any needed subfolders, and then copy down the files from the internet.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>I have <strong>VS Code</strong> set up so I can right-click a folder and choose &#8220;<strong>Open in Code</strong>&#8221; to automatically add its folders (and hence, the project) to VS Code. I chose to add this option when I installed VS Code. So, its what I do &#8211; I essentially import the project into VS Code by right-clicking the folder and choosing &#8220;Open in Code&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>To upload an existing project from your computer onto GitHub:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Open <strong>Git Bash</strong> (or another terminal/command line program if your using a different one)</li>\n<li>Navigate to the directory/folder where you keep your projects (you might need to Google this, since instructions might be different depending on your terminal program). Its the same process as Step 4 in the previous section.</li>\n<li>Type &#8220;<strong>git add .</strong>&#8221; This adds/copies everything in the project folder to GitHub. I think the period is a special flag that means &#8220;all&#8221;. Wait a few seconds for the terminal program to copy up the files.</li>\n<li>Type &#8220;<strong>git commit -m</strong>&#8221; and a space and then add a comment in quotes. For example, I last used: <em>git commit -m &#8220;Most formatting done. Top area and section spaces need to be added.&#8221;</em>\n<ol>\n<li>Don&#8217;t use special characters, like exclamation points.</li>\n<li>You might be asked to enter your GitHub username and password, so have them handy.</li>\n<li>I ended up changing my password on GitHub, because the prompt didn&#8217;t recognize it when I typed it several times.</li>\n<li>The process probably takes about the same amount of time as Step 5 from the previous section.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Type &#8220;<strong>git push</strong>&#8221; to push the files your uploaded to wherever pushing sends them. I think its what incorporates the files into the branch.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"614\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/07/simplified-git-instructions-for-lambda-school-students/git_upload/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"595,656\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"git_upload\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=272\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=595\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-614\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=595&#038;h=656\" alt=\"git_upload\" width=\"595\" height=\"656\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg 595w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=136&amp;h=150 136w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/git_upload.jpg?w=272&amp;h=300 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /></p>\n<h4>To submit a pull request:</h4>\n<p>A pull request is something like a request for comments (RFC). Its an alert that lets other people know that you&#8217;ve pushed changes to a branch in a repository in GitHub (and probably other similar software packages). When one is submitted, it basically gives other people the opportunity to reach out and review the updated code that was pushed and then contact the uploader to discuss any concerns. I think that after its accepted, it then gets merged into the main codebase.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Click on the &#8220;<strong>Pull requests</strong>&#8221; tab right under the repository&#8217;s name (usually under your name and the project name).</li>\n<li>Click on the green &#8220;<strong>New Pull Request</strong>&#8221; button on the right-side of the screen.</li>\n<li>Click on the green &#8220;<strong>Create Pull Request</strong>&#8221; button on the left-side of the screen.</li>\n<li>Type a title in the top text box, and optionally more detailed info in the larger text box below it.</li>\n<li>Click the green &#8220;<strong>Create Pull Request</strong>&#8221; button below the text boxes.</li>\n<li>Once the screen refreshed, the URL to the pull request can then be shared. Its the new address of the page onscreen. I think it&#8217;ll have a <strong>/pull/####&#8217;s</strong> at the end. This is the link that&#8217;s submitted to Lambda when they want to review your work, too.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>My understanding of how to use GitHub is incomplete.

recommended some apps to our group for taking notes during the course and for keeping track of how long we took to complete projects. Here is a list of these applications:</p>\n<h4>Note-taking:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\"><strong>Notion</strong></a>: Our team lead said that Notion has essentially replaced Evernote. One feature it has over Evernote is that is has a searchable database of some sort.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://evernote.com/\"><strong>Evernote</strong></a>: I&#8217;ve been using this for years, on the desktop and my phone. I mainly use it to take quick notes for a variety of things, keep lists of important things and to track when I fed the baby and how many ounces she drank.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://products.office.com/en-us/onenote/digital-note-taking-app?rtc=1\"><strong>OneNote</strong></a>: Its comprehensive, but I have no experience with it yet.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://bear.app/\"><strong>Bear</strong></a>: I also have no experience with this &#8211; and its an Apple-only product.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Time-tracking:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://clockify.me/\"><strong>Clockify</strong></a>: Our team lead highly recommended this. He uses it for everything. He said that we can time ourselves when we&#8217;re doing projects to see how long they take us, and as we repeat certain functions, we can see how much we&#8217;ve improved by noting the duration completing certain tasks now takes us. He uses it for more though &#8211; like seeing how long he slept, and other things.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef\"><strong>Marinara: Pomodoro Assistant</strong></a>: This one&#8217;s a Chrome extension. Pomodoro is a technique in which a person spends a certain amount of concentrated time working/studying and then takes a short break to get up and move around and clear his/her mind. I read about it a few years ago. I think it was something like 25 mins of focused effort and then 5 mins away. Its supposed to increase productivity and reduce burnout. I think our team lead said that he uses 45 mins of focused work and then 5 mins away.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As an aside, he also recommended that if we rewatch video tutorials, we consider increasing the speed. I&#8217;ve seen other people on YouTube make the same recommendation. Setting a video&#8217;s playback speed to 1.5 or 2X might be a bit much, but apparently, speed can be increased in smaller increments as well, like 1.1 or 1.2. I&#8217;ll experiment with this later. He said that its useful for rewatching lectures that run 2-3 hours long.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Yesterday, our team lead at Lambda School recommended some apps to our group for taking notes during the course and for keeping track of how long we took to complete projects.

School: Full Stack &#8211; Week 1, Day 1","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-8X","content":"<p>Its been a long day. I&#8217;ve been getting up at 4-5 AM for the past month, or maybe 5 weeks now, mainly to read stuff to prep for Lambda School and to write blog posts about it. Today, I got up around 5, looked at blog, video and podcast content from other Lambda students and shared their sites on my blog. Then, my first day in the full stack track started.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m in NY, so for me, the hours are basically 11 AM &#8211; 8 PM. I began by joining the <strong>Slack</strong> and letting someone in the general WEB23 channel know that I hadn&#8217;t been assigned a TL (team lead) yet. Within about 10 mins, I was assigned to <strong>Reed Turgeon</strong> and he invited me to a separate channel just for my group. This was probably around 10:30 AM.</p>\n<p>By 11:00, Reed messaged everyone in the group&#8217;s Slack channel with a <strong>Zoom</strong> link and initiated our first online meetup. It ran for half an hour and I met my team. We&#8217;re a group of nine. There are no women in my group, and everyone is younger than I am. Our backgrounds and experience coding varied significantly. Two people came from literature backgrounds and had zero coding experience except for the pre-course. Two others had more experience and had even gone to other bootcamps. The rest were mainly like me &#8211; they had some familiarity with coding, but no real background in it.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"572\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/lambda-cohort/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1200,800\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"lambda cohort\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-572\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=1200&#038;h=800\" alt=\"lambda cohort\" width=\"1200\" height=\"800\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg 1200w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=150&amp;h=100 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=300&amp;h=200 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=768&amp;h=512 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-cohort.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=683 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" /></p>\n<p>Reed had us introduce ourselves, pick an animal to represent us if we were to reincarnate as one and share it with the group, and discuss our familiarity with coding. There were some interesting animal choices. Historically, I&#8217;ve identified with wolves, but I told the group that at this point, whatever was the roundest, slowest dog they could think of would basically be my spirit animal. One of the others picked a chicken. I can&#8217;t remember why right now, and another chose birds in general for the ability to fly.</p>\n<p>We talked about general expectations and about how to get help if we needed it &#8211; including discussion about Lambda&#8217;s FLEX program, which is essentially when a student scores a 1 (the lowest score our of 3 on Challenges) twice in a row and can&#8217;t catch back up. The student can opt to move to a cohort that&#8217;s one unit behind and retake the unit that&#8217;s been proving difficult. It something that came up later in the day as well, and seems to really hit people when they move from JavaScript, later in the course, to React and Redux and other frameworks.</p>\n<p>After the Zoom session with our team lead and the group, we were immediately invited to another Zoom session with our instructor for the first few weeks (maybe the first month), <strong>Brit Hemming</strong>. Brit was not previously a Lambda student, but went to another bootcamp in Canada. She then worked professionally as a developer for about 5 years, and is now an instructor at Lambda. She helped found a group &#8211; I can&#8217;t remember the name right now &#8211; that teaches coding around the world. She also loves to travel, so she&#8217;s been to about 35 other countries and has taught coding in many of them. Its an impressive feat.</p>\n<p>Brit walked us through what our time at Lambda would look like for the next 9 months and answered questions from the greater WEB23 cohort, which was well over 100 people. We then took a short break (she tends to favor timed 5-minute breaks) and she walked us through transforming a big block of text on <strong>CodePen</strong> into a more properly-formatted web page using <strong>semantic HTML</strong>. We were invited to code along with her, but for some reason, when Slack and Zoom are opened at the same time on my computer, the performance hit is too big for me to do anything other than watch, which is what I did. The entire session was recorded and later released so we can watch it again, if needed.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"573\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/lambda-britt/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1680,1050\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"lambda britt\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-573\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=1680&#038;h=1050\" alt=\"lambda britt\" width=\"1680\" height=\"1050\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg 1680w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=150&amp;h=94 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=300&amp;h=188 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=768&amp;h=480 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/lambda-britt.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=640 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1680px) 100vw, 1680px\" /></p>\n<p>Apparently, EVERY session of every class is recorded and archived, and we&#8217;re encouraged to watch them, to see how other instructors covered the same material. There were already more than a dozen archived video sessions just for day 1.</p>\n<p>We took another break, and then Brit returned to the same CodePen page and walked us through formatting the page with CSS. I learned that there were some videos pertaining to today&#8217;s lessons that I should have watched before class started. This is true of every class, so I&#8217;m either going to have to watch them after class each day, or early in the AM when I get up. They&#8217;re located in the training kit for the class, and I think can also be found in the Google calendar for the class.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not going to remember everything, but I know we looked at various html keywords, parent/child selectors, css specificity, inheritance, pseudo selectors, some fun css keywords like hover, using web fonts (like google fonts), semantic html and other things.</p>\n<p>Its all a bit of a jumble in my head right now, but we ended up breaking at 2:00 EST and were given assignments. There were projects that we had to complete (2 of them, today) and optional Challenges. The 2nd project included several stretch goals. I also watched the videos that I should have watched prior to class and completed the code-along Challenges that were part of the lesson for those videos. This proved fortunate, because the concepts that we learned in the code-along Challenges were duplicated in the two projects that we had to complete, so I was able to reference my earlier efforts to complete the projects.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/08\\/05\\/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 198px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"198\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 198px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"198\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/semantic-html/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"194\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"575\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/semantic-html.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1240,978\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"semantic html\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/semantic-html.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/semantic-html.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/semantic-html.jpg?w=246&#038;h=194&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"194\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"semantic html\" alt=\"semantic html\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 194px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 198px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"198\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/css/\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"194\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"574\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1240,978\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"css\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/css.jpg?w=246&#038;h=194&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"194\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"194\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"css\" alt=\"css\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 194px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>The first one called for us to take a block of text and format it using semantic html in accordance with a set of instructions. It didn&#8217;t take very long to complete and was purely text. There was very little formatting, if any at all.</p>\n<p>The second one has us use CSS to format a variation of the html page we had previously worked on. It included images. These were the stretch goals:</p>\n<pre>***DO NOT ATTEMPT STRETCH UNTIL YOU ARE FINISHED WITH \nEVERYTHING ELSE!***\n\nStretch Task: Fork your final work and see how much you\ncan change the design without changing the HTML. Try to\ntransform the site by only using CSS selectors.\n\nStretch Task: Look at CSS animations and see if you could\nintegrate them on the navigation hovers.\n\nStretch Task: Pick a navigation item and create a new page\nwith the same header and footer as the home page. Example:\nyou could make a new page just for cookies. Be creative and\nhave fun coming up with your own unique content and styles.\n\n*/\n\n/*======= Create a new universal selector that changes the\nfont color to: #3C373B */</pre>\n<p>I completed the two projects and submitted them, but didn&#8217;t work on the stretch goals. We did learn that stretch goals later on become <strong>MVP</strong> (minimal viable product) criteria in future projects, so its a good idea to try them ahead of time, when they&#8217;re presented as stretch goals.</p>\n<p>The Challenges varied greatly in difficulty. The first one was just like one of the video challenges and the first project I completed: format a text block into a web page using semantic html. This mainly made use of tags like &lt;h1&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;, along with &lt;a href=&gt;.</p>\n<p>The second one was more of a doozy. It dealt with inheritance and specificity using html and css. There were nested classes, some were like five levels deep. We had to change the color of text in each level to a specific color using css. I wasn&#8217;t able to complete it in the time that we had, but some others did using inline styling. After the day ended and I ate something and had the kids sit on me for a while, I returned and was able to complete it all using classes. Some of the nested classes were called using something akin to dot notation, and others were called using spaces in between nested generations. I&#8217;m actually still a bit unclear about the hierarchy, so I&#8217;ll need to revisit it again later.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"576\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/05/lambda-school-full-stack-day-1/inheritance/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1240,978\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"inheritance\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-576\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=1240&#038;h=978\" alt=\"inheritance\" width=\"1240\" height=\"978\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg 1240w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=150&amp;h=118 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=300&amp;h=237 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=768&amp;h=606 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/inheritance.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=808 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px\" /></p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of stuff that I&#8217;m likely forgetting which I&#8217;ll also probably not remember to write about later. I&#8217;m not sure how frequently I&#8217;ll be able to blog about the course, as it gets busier, but I&#8217;ll try to at least outline or summarize future sessions. We covered a lot of material, considering I haven&#8217;t looked at html or css since writing blog posts about them in the early part of the pre-course a month ago. I&#8217;m generally happy with my first day, however.</p>\n<p>Oh, at the end of the day, we submitted a form with our thoughts about the day and how we fared, then we had &#8220;standup&#8221; which is basically a meeting with our group and TL during which we just talk over the day&#8217;s events. The TL provided us with links to a bunch of programs that he said he wished his own TL had given to him early on in the course. They were programs for note-taking, timing ourselves, scheduling breaks from the computer, and maybe 1-2 other things. I already use <strong>Evernote,</strong> which was one of the programs he suggested for taking notes, but the rest were unfamiliar to me. I&#8217;ll share links to them later.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a long day.
