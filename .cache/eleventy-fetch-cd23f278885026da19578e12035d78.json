These are the processes by which the contents of a web page are generated &amp; delivered to a viewer&#8217;s browser. These methods describe <em>when </em>&amp; <em>where </em>content is generated before it appears in a user&#8217;s browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Content can be generated before the user visits the site (static site generation), when a page is requested (server-side rendering), or dynamically using JavaScript after the page loads in the <strong>browser</strong> (client-side rendering).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Where</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rendering can happen in three places: on the server (when a request is processed before its sent to the browser), in the browser (after the browser loads a blank HTML page &amp; JavaScript renders the content) or at build time (from a previously-generated static file).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, why does this matter? Each of these methods affects key areas of the user experience as well as back-end processes. For the user, the rendering method primarily impacts <strong>performance </strong>&amp; <strong>interactivity</strong>. Delivering static HTML is much faster than handling complex JavaScript. But, while sending pure HTML is fine for static sites, sites that are interactive, like an ecommerce site or a web application, will have components that need to update in real time. This requires client-side JavaScript, which calls for more browser resources for it to render content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the back-end, <strong>SEO</strong>, <strong>hosting </strong>&amp; the <strong>developer experience</strong> are impacted by the rendering method. Search engines need to see content easily, which means that statically-generated sites &amp; server-side rendered sites perform best for SEO. Client-side rendering don&#8217;t make use of permanently-stored web pages, so web spiders can&#8217;t crawl the pages &#8211; their content doesn&#8217;t exist until they&#8217;re rendered. In the case of server-side rendered sites, the server generates content <em>per request</em>, so it exists in the HTML <em>at the time of request</em> &amp; spiders can see it. For web applications, SEO is often unimportant, but user interactivity &amp; the developer experience are vital, which makes client-side rendering favorable. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2903\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/10/ssg-ssr-csr-wtf/ssr-wtf-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"4032,1816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1748795331&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;320&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ssr-wtf-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-1.jpg?w=1024\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2903\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SSR</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The original rendering method was SSR (server-side rendering). Its how the web worked in the beginning &#8211; a user typed a URL into the browser, the browser sent a request to the web server, the server ran some back-end code &amp; generated HTML. This HTML was then sent back to the browser which then rendered it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content generated this way is always fresh, which is a strength for pages with data that frequently changes on the back-end. Its also good for SEO since the content is included in the HTML. However, its slower than SSG because HTML is generated every time the server receives a request. This also means that websites with high traffic will put more pressure on their servers to generate content to satisfy requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ecommerce product pages that show real-time data like pricing &amp; inventory are good candidates for this approach. Tools like <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>Express </strong>coupled with a frontend library or framework like <strong>React </strong>or <strong>Vue </strong>&amp; traditional <strong>PHP </strong>sites make use of this method.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">CSR</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Client-side rendering is a method in which the browser loads a basic HTML page with a JavaScript bundle. Once loaded, the browser runs the JavaScript to render the content. It was developed as websites became more interactive (think <strong>Gmail</strong>, <strong>Facebook</strong>, dashboards, etc.) &amp; developers moved more logic to the browser. Data is grabbed after the page loads using APIs like <strong>fetch()</strong> &amp; <strong>Axios</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CSR is dynamic &amp; interactive. Applications built using the approach feel like a desktop application. Its great for <strong>single-page applications</strong> (SPAs). Because all of the rendering is done by the client, no server rendering is needed, so hosting is simpler, often only needing a front-end to be deployed. However, there&#8217;s often a slower initial load because the content isn&#8217;t included in the HTML &amp; its not good for SEO unless combined with tools like pre-rendering. Its possible for applications to flash blank or loading states (loading spinners) before content appears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This approach is commonly used when building dashboards or web applications (like <strong>Trello </strong>or <strong>DevLeads</strong>). <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Angular </strong>and <strong>headless frontends</strong> that call APIs all make use of this method.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">SSG</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Static-site generation is a method in which the HTML for each page is<em> generated ahead of time</em>, at build time, and stored as plain <code>.html</code> files. When a user visits the site, the server just sends that static HTML file. Because of this, its very fast. Its just sending out static files from a <strong>CDN</strong> or server. The static pages are good for SEO because the content is already in the HTML &amp; its secure because there&#8217;s no backend code running at request time. Backend code can still run at build time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blogs and brochure sites are good candidates for SSG. Tools like <strong>Astro</strong>, <strong>11ty</strong>, <strong>Hugo </strong>&amp; <strong>Next.js</strong> (in SSG mode) make use of this approach. However, its not ideal for pages with content that changes frequently or need to be personalized per user &amp; site rebuilds can be slow if there are a lot of pages to be generated.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2904\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/10/ssg-ssr-csr-wtf/ssr-wtf-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"4032,1816\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1748795768&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.025&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ssr-wtf-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-2.jpg?w=1024\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/ssr-wtf-2.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2904\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Moar, plz</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now additional <strong>hybrid rendering</strong> methods available as well.

years. Most of my experience in that arena comes from back when I lived in NY &amp; ran a one-man tech support LLC for a few years because somehow my full-time job wasn&#8217;t enough to do me in. This time, I&#8217;m going to use what I&#8217;ve been learning since 2019 to provide web services to small businesses &amp; individuals through the web development LLC that I started in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two big concerns of mine were having options for clients who want to maintain their own content &amp; having an ecommerce solution for clients who want to do something similar &amp; manage their own catalog. I looked at a lot of options including things like <strong>Shopify</strong>, <strong>SnipCart </strong>&amp; a ton of different free &amp; paid services. Ultimately, I decided to try working with <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2025/03/20/headless-wordpress/\">headless WordPress</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" data-attachment-id=\"2870\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/06/headless-wordpress/headless-wp-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"headless-wp-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-01.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2870\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why headless WordPress?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve used WordPress for my own personal blogs since 2011. I&#8217;ve also used it professionally for clients who already had WordPress sites &amp; wanted me to continue using it on theirs. This includes using WordPress builders like<strong> Divi</strong> &amp; <strong>Elementor</strong>. Ultimately, I didn&#8217;t like the experience of any of the builders. For my own sites, using the default editor was fine, because I didn&#8217;t know how to code when I started blogging &amp; primarily wanted to get content out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that I can code, I want to continue to do so, for the flexibility, customization &amp; control that it offers. There&#8217;s a lot of freedom with having the ability to build out anything that you can think of, as opposed to relying on a theme &amp; hoping it has all of the options &amp; the style that you want for a website. And, while WordPress has a reputation for not being secure, I&#8217;ve learned that it actually is very secure. The main vectors of attack on WordPress sites are actually from third-party plug-ins, which don&#8217;t necessarily all conform to the same security standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Headless WordPress lets clients keep using WordPress&#8217; GUI for content management while separating (decoupling) the front-end. So, they can write new posts or pages &amp; I can then build out custom front-ends with tools like <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, or other technologies &amp; fetch the content via the WordPress <strong>REST API</strong> &amp; render it however I like. This same approach can even extend to ecommerce setups using plugins like <strong>WooCommerce</strong>. Clients get the ease of managing products through WordPress &amp; I can create a custom storefront experience for their customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"984\" height=\"1024\" data-attachment-id=\"2876\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/06/headless-wordpress/headless-wp-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"999,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"headless-wp-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-04.jpg?w=288\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-04.jpg?w=984\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-04.jpg?w=984\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2876\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Vanilla JavaScript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I first started experimenting with headless WordPress about a month ago, I wanted to get familiar with the API so I built out a small project using vanilla JavaScript that fetched posts from my coding blog &amp; rendered them. I found that the content of the post bodies was sent as a big HTML string &amp; there were endpoints that could be called for other information, like featured images, tags, categories, slugs, excerpts &amp; more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the WordPress API returns the last 10 blog posts that were written unless a different number is specified in the API call. I built out a small function that mapped through this response &amp; rendered the post contents. I was horrified to see all of the classes that WordPress attaches to so many elements &amp; that horror was only deepened when I found that the CSS  for the returned content isn&#8217;t openly available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I searched &amp; found a library that included a lot of base WordPress styles, but not everything &amp; none at all for WordPress themes. So, ultimately, I used my blog as a visual reference &amp; wrote out my own styles for most of the returned elements using a combination of the element types &amp; the classes provided by WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This worked for a lot of the content that I wanted to render, but there were some that were very difficult to handle in this way. Image galleries, in particular, confounded me. Ultimately, I didn&#8217;t lay them out in the same way that they are in my blog. I&#8217;ll have to see if there&#8217;s a way to solve this later on. I have some ideas to test that I&#8217;ll report on once I&#8217;ve given them a go.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" data-attachment-id=\"2872\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/06/headless-wordpress/headless-wp-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"headless-wp-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-02.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-02.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2872\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Astro</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My friend <a href=\"https://bsky.app/profile/devmansam.net\">Sam</a> went through the <a href=\"https://astro.build/\">Astro</a> tutorial a few months ago &amp; got really excited about it. He recommended it to me &amp; although I looked at some videos about it, I didn&#8217;t carve out time to try it until a few weeks ago. Astro is a server-side web framework for JavaScript. It allows developers to mix &amp; match components written in most of the major JavaScript libraries &amp; frameworks like <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>Svelte </strong>&amp; so on alongside its own <strong>Islands </strong>architecture &amp; <strong>JSX</strong>. A strength is that it renders sites as HTML so that delivery is lightning-fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After finishing the tutorial, I used Astro to rebuild the headless WordPress site I had previously made with vanilla JavaScript. It was impressive but had some hiccups. For example, I encountered weird encoding issues where apostrophes and special characters were replaced with things like <code>\"â€™\"</code>. I tried several fixes, and the issue eventually resolved when I switched to prerendering on the server instead of client-side rendering. I’m still not 100% sure why that worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I experimented with a lot of things building out this iteration, including pagination, infinite scrolling, prerendering, learning about IntersectionObserver, prefetching, layout components, dynamic routing &amp; so much more. Astro is very powerful &amp; I&#8217;m definitely going to revisit it again once my brain has had time to process everything &amp; I&#8217;ve looked at some other SSG frameworks for comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" data-attachment-id=\"2874\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/06/06/headless-wordpress/headless-wp-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-03.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"headless-wp-03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-03.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-03.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/headless-wp-03.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2874\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">11ty</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, I started exploring <a class=\"\" href=\"https://www.11ty.dev/\">11ty (Eleventy)</a>, an older but highly regarded static site generator. I’ve read that it partly inspired Astro’s creation. It’s already being used by developers building headless WordPress sites &amp; the community has documented workflows &amp; tools to make that process smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What attracted me to 11ty was its speed. It&#8217;s known for blazing-fast site generation &#8211; potentially even faster than Astro. One of the tools built for 11ty can pull in all the content from a WordPress blog, convert it to a supported format (Markdown or HTML, I can’t remember which), fetch all assets, and even rewrite asset paths automatically. I&#8217;m planning to try it out as a faster SSG alternative to SSR approaches and see how it stacks up in practice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m getting ready to freelance again for the first time in a few years.

You Need a Hidden HTML Form for Netlify Forms in a React App","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2025/05/30/why-you-need-a-hidden-html-form-for-netlify-forms-in-a-react-app/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-JM","content":"\n<p>Wow. I haven&#8217;t blogged in 7 months again. A lot of stuff is happening, but I&#8217;m going to focus on explaining something that I finally took the time to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in 2021, I wrote <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2021/01/29/easily-add-email-to-contact-forms-with-netlify/\">this post</a> about using <strong>Netlify </strong>to handle contact forms on a website. The gist is that you could set up a contact form on your website &amp; not have to build out a backend to make it work. That process could be delegated to Netlify. I used it to add working contact forms to <strong>HTML </strong>sites, <strong>React </strong>sites &amp;<strong> Next.js</strong> sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To make it work for React &amp; Next.js sites, we had to add a hidden 2nd copy of the form to the <code>/public</code> folder using HTML. I never really understood why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last night, I helped someone to get their contact form working on their portfolio using Netlify. Her site was built using React &amp; the form wasn&#8217;t working. I looked at some React sites that I built &amp; found that the big difference between mine &amp; hers was that I had that HTML version of the form in the <code>/public</code> folder, as well as having the &#8220;real&#8221; one in React. She got her contact form to work, but I didn&#8217;t remember *why* the static HTML version needed to be there, so I researched.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">React Renders at Runtime, Netlify Reads at Build Time</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>React apps are rendered <strong>dynamically</strong>. The content of each &#8220;page&#8221; is created by JavaScript in the browser at <strong>runtime</strong>. When your React app is built, the output doesn’t contain actual HTML for your form &#8211; it contains a skeletal HTML file (<code>index.html</code>) and some JavaScript. That JavaScript dynamically creates everything you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Netlify&#8217;s form handling, on the other hand, is set up by scanning the <strong>static </strong>HTML files in your site at<strong> build time</strong>. It doesn&#8217;t run your JavaScript. So if your form is only created by React, Netlify can’t see it. It doesn’t exist yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add a Hidden HTML &#8220;Dummy&#8221; Form</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To fix this, we give Netlify a static version of the form that it can see at build time:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Create an HTML form with the same <strong><code>name</code> </strong>and <strong>field names</strong> as your React form</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Put it in your /<code>public</code> folder (either in <code>index.html</code> or a separate file)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Mark it as <code>hidden</code> so it never appears to users</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;form name=\"contact\" netlify netlify-honeypot=\"bot-field\" hidden&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input name='phone' type='tel'/&gt;\n  &lt;textarea name=\"message\"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. This dummy form gives Netlify everything it needs to register and configure the form submission endpoint on their servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The React Form Is the One Users Actually Use</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When your app runs in the browser, your React-rendered form is the one users actually see &amp; interact with:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;form name=\"contact\" method=\"POST\" netlify\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form-name\" value=\"contact\" /&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"name\" type=\"text\" required /&gt;\n  &lt;input name=\"email\" type=\"email\" required /&gt;\n  &lt;input name='phone' type='tel'/&gt;\n  &lt;textarea name=\"message\" required&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;\n  &lt;button type=\"submit\"&gt;Send&lt;/button&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This form sends a POST request to Netlify with the correct <code>form-name</code> and field names. Netlify doesn’t care that it wasn’t part of the static build. As long as the data matches what it expects, it accepts the submission.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Think of the Dummy Form as a Body Double</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The hidden HTML form is a body double. Its just there so that Netlify has a form name &amp; field names to register the form. The real one in React does the actual work. That&#8217;s the one that the users see. Because users never interact with the dummy form &amp; it never gets submitted, there&#8217;s no conflict with the React form, even though they have the same name &amp; fields. Only the React one should include a submit button &amp; have form logic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This setup was strange to me at first. I didn&#8217;t quite get why we needed the HTML version of the form in a React site. Now that I understand build time vs runtime, it makes sense. It gives Netlify a static page to work with while users interact with the React interface. Hopefully, it clears things up for some of you who are seeing this for the first time.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Wow. I haven&#8217;t blogged in 7 months again.

forms: How to get the value from a checkbox","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/10/16/html-forms-how-to-get-the-value-from-a-checkbox/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Iw","content":"\n<p>Its been about 8 months since I last posted here. I&#8217;m way overdue, but life has been happening. I&#8217;ve been interviewing at different places for a software engineer position and wanted to talk through questions that I was asked at some of them. This is one that I was asked about and had to write code for on paper, in front of  a panel of three people. They had a bunch of form-related questions on one side of the paper and SQL questions on the other. For this question, there was a screenshot of an area of a form with about 30 checkboxes. They asked how I would get the value from only one checkbox in the section.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The short answer is that we could use JavaScript to grab the checkbox and get its value. There are several ways to target an HTML element using JavaScript. The most direct way is to give the element an ID and then use <strong>.getElementById()</strong>, but individual form elements might not necessarily have an ID. In that case, we can use <strong>.querySelector()</strong> along with an attribute of some kind to target the element. Here&#8217;s an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\"><code>&lt;form id=\"myForm\"&gt;\n  &lt;label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"option1\" value=\"Option 1\"&gt; Option 1\n  &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"option2\" value=\"Option 2\"&gt; Option 2\n  &lt;/label&gt;\n  &lt;label&gt;\n    &lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"option3\" value=\"Option 3\"&gt; Option 3\n  &lt;/label&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n\n&lt;button id=\"getValueBtn\"&gt;Get Value&lt;/button&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, we have a form with three checkboxes. Each checkbox has a <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong> attribute. They&#8217;re all different from each other (&#8220;option1&#8221;, &#8220;option2&#8221;, &#8220;option3&#8221;). None has an ID that can be targeted, so we&#8217;ll use the name attribute to target a given checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\"><code>document.getElementById(\"getValueBtn\").addEventListener(\"click\", function() {\n  const checkbox = document.querySelector('input&#091;name=\"option1\"]')\n\n  if (checkbox.checked) {\n    console.log(\"Checked\")\n  } else {\n    console.log(\"Not checked\")\n  }\n})</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The JavaScript above targets the button by ID and adds an event listener to it. The listener is waiting for a click event, and when that event happens to the button it fires off the anonymous function that&#8217;s inside of the event listener. That function logs whether the checkbox is checked or not by seeing if the <strong>.checked</strong> property is true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Note the query selector. It&#8217;s not using a class or ID to target the checkbox. Instead, it&#8217;s finding the element (input) and selecting the right one using the name attribute &#8211; in this case, &#8220;option1&#8221;. The square brackets aren&#8217;t JavaScript bracket notation. They&#8217;re an <strong>attribute selector</strong>. The text inside is also not considered a key/value pair. It&#8217;s an <strong>HTML attribute</strong>. This is why you&#8217;re not supposed to cross the streams when busting ghosts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">But, whatabout&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\"><code>&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"fruit\" value=\"apple\"&gt; Apple\n&lt;input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"fruit\" value=\"banana\"&gt; Banana</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\"><code>const appleCheckbox = document.querySelector('input&#091;name=\"fruit\"]&#091;value=\"apple\"]')\nconst bananaCheckbox = document.querySelector('input&#091;name=\"fruit\"]&#091;value=\"banana\"]')</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above example, &#8220;apple&#8221; and &#8220;banana&#8221; are checkboxes and both of them have the same <strong>name</strong> attribute. This differs from the first example in which each checkbox had a unique name. Note that the query selectors now target the checkboxes a little differently. They&#8217;re using both the <strong>name</strong> and <strong>value</strong> attributes to find the right checkbox.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s possible to use only the value attribute, but that&#8217;s considered less safe to do unless the document in the DOM is assured to only have elements with unique values. Using the name attribute narrows down the scope of elements being targeted, and combining that with the value attribute further zeroes in on the specific checkbox (or element) being sought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a Codepen project that illustrates this last case using both name and value attributes to select a checkbox: <a href=\"https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/OJKmENm\">https://codepen.io/vishalicious/pen/OJKmENm</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been about 8 months since I last posted here.

<strong>Tech In Motion</strong>. It brought together C-suite panelists from <strong>Curantis Solutions</strong>, <strong>Ericsson </strong>and <strong>Motion Recruitment Partners</strong> and was moderated by one of the co-hosts from <strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-onug-podcast/id1656780383\">The Wages of Cybercrime</a></strong> podcast.

He has a background in tech, knows how to code and is now CTO at a company that develops healthcare solutions. Some of the questions that he posed revolved around how AI could be used to augment solutions to these challenges:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What do we have to work on to keep the business going (core services)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What can we do to grow the business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What is the business able to handle\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>What does it need from technology</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What can tech provide</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What can we do to transform the business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cybersecurity\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Every piece of patient data collected is a target for someone to go after</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>He also brought up the following topics:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Digital evolution: Using AI to inform how businesses make decisions and the processes used to run business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Data is a focus: Using AI and Amazon tooling, analytics, user workflow and optimizations to inform business decisions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Use case: Rolling out an event-driven billing system to replace what their solution already uses (this might be a scheduled system)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These next concerns were more specific to Curantis and were being worked on by the team, but were issues that other companies could learn from. They include steps that need to be taken in order to properly make use of AI, although it’s possible that AI could be used to take some of these steps:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Previous things that are important:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Time to market</li>\n\n\n\n<li>User experience</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Cleaning up data\n<ul

/ Candidates</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>From here on, Stephanie Rollis and John Rosenbaum contributed significantly to the panel, with Mark Tierney also adding his two cents where appropriate.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Half-life of tech skills is 18 months, have to keep upskilling and embrace continuous learning</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Many corporate cultures didn&#8217;t support learning on the job, but now companies need to help employees stay current (particularly with regard to AI)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Need to focus on tech teams knowing the needs of the industry, they have to ask questions and know the product that&#8217;s being sold\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The tech exists to create value and drive revenue</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How will talent be developed differently &#8211; and why &#8211; with regard to AI\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Understand use cases with AI, pay attention to what you&#8217;re trying to accomplish and you&#8217;ll understand the skills needed to do those things</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Misuse of AI: Intimacy in the hiring process is more important than quantity\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Candidate applications that are obviously using AI are discarded more often than hand-crafted applications</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Give people the opportunity to: Try, fail, learn, grow</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Growing need for end-to-end engineers instead of overspecialized engineers\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The hot trend or tool of today without fundamentals won&#8217;t be valuable in 5 years</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Sometimes engineers are ahead of what the business is able to support\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>They might have great ideas, but it&#8217;s too much change for the business</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What impact will it have\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Generating revenue or decreasing expense</li>\n\n\n\n<li>What customer service will it provide</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The culture of an organization can be a hurdle\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Marketing, Sales and Finance have different sets of ideas</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have to think of business as an interconnected entity, end-to-end</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Stop looking at ourselves internally, how do we compare to competitors\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Some places are too internally-focused, even department-focused</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Business people need to be able to sell engineers on an idea, or they won&#8217;t sell customers on it</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Engineers get stuck in their old routines and aren&#8217;t willing to learn new methods</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Product works with brilliant technologists and needs to articulate what their innovations bring to the customers\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Techies need to learn business, they&#8217;re no longer just coding in a back room</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-2 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure

topics and themes, touching upon a multitude of ideas and inquiries. Some topics were explored with greater depth, while others were posed almost rhetorically, reflecting the range of perspectives shared during the meetup. Throughout it, the role of AI emerged as a focal point, representing a rapidly evolving yet nascent frontier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I write this, <a href=\"https://soraapp.com/welcome\">Sora</a> just made the news, tying-in with the meetup that <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/\">Tech Forum Rancho Cucamonga</a> held last month that focused on the use of AI in screenwriting and optioning movie scripts. ChatGPT just started communicating with users in Spanglish and leaving what people are describing as eerie responses that imply that it’s in the room with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These leaps and setbacks bring to mind the note that Tierney used to close-out the panel discussion. He referenced the often-misattributed &#8220;ancient Chinese proverb,&#8221; &#8220;May you live in interesting times,&#8221; which is both a blessing and a curse, signifying upheaval and uncertainty. The proverb is accompanied by two lesser-known lines, of which I was unaware: &#8220;May you be recognized by powerful people&#8221; and &#8220;May you get what you wish for.&#8221; Together, they encapsulate the complexities and potential consequences of navigating transformative periods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The exploration of AI&#8217;s myriad applications across diverse industries invites comparison with the story of Pandora&#8217;s Box, tempting us with the promise of innovation while presenting unforeseen challenges and consequences. As we navigate these uncharted waters, it becomes more and more imperative to tread cautiously, mindful of the profound societal and philosophical impact of our technological advancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-attachment-id=\"2611\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/22/meetup-tech-leadership-strategies-for-scaling-growth-talent-ai-in-2024/attachment/11/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1080\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"11\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2611\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/11.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n","excerpt":"<p>Two weeks ago, I attended a meetup called “Tech Leadership Strategies for Scaling Growth, Talent &amp; AI in 2024” hosted by Tech In Motion.

asynchronous JavaScript: async/await vs promise chaining","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/15/basic-asynchronous-javascript-async-await-vs-promise-chaining/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Fs","content":"\n<p>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day. I was going through some <strong><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/\">Scrimba</a></strong> material in the <strong><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend\">Frontend Developer Path</a></strong> because it was revamped last year and new content was added while old content was removed or placed in different areas (a big change was the <strong>Next-Level JavaScript</strong> unit being removed and new content being added to the <strong>Essential JavaScript</strong> unit). While doing so, I started comparing code from an old project that calls out to an API for some data to render. Requesting data from an API is an asynchronous function &#8211; the response that the function is waiting for is wrapped in an RSVP-like package called a <strong><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise\">promise</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Promises, promises&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A promise is &#8220;the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value&#8221;. It&#8217;s often a response from an outside source, like an API, that fulfills a request. Essentially, some code in an application asks for data from the API and the API &#8220;promises&#8221; to get back to the requester. Sometimes, this response is a success &#8211; the data that was asked for is sent. Other times, it fails. In that case, an error object is sent with a message inside that (hopefully) explains what went wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two different approaches (without involving outside libraries like axios) that I&#8217;m aware of for handling promises in JavaScript. The first is called <strong>promise chaining</strong>. It relies on two methods to operate: <code>.then()</code> and <code>.catch()</code>. The other approach is writing asynchronous functions using <code>async</code> and <code>await</code>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Promise chaining</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>fetch(\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\")<br>    .then(response =&gt; response.json())<br>    .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))<br>    .catch(error =&gt; console.error('Error:', error))\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above example uses a <code>fetch()</code> request to ask an API for some data. If the API responds with the data, the response is converted into <strong>JSON</strong> format using the <code>.json()</code> method and logged to the console. If it responds with an error, that error message is logged to the console instead. The above approach is called <strong>promise chaining</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>fetch()</code> is a built-in JavaScript function for making requests across a network. It returns a promise. The basic syntax is to provide it with a URL to an API endpoint to reach out to. The response from the API is then processed via a callback function using the <code>.then()</code> method. Errors are processed via another callback function using the <code>.catch()</code> method.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>.then() </code>can be used to change (mutate) the response and additional <code>.then()</code> methods can be called, one after another, to further work with the response. This is another example of promise chaining. <code>.then()</code> is commonly used with promises to handle asynchronous operations. It&#8217;s used to register callbacks that will be invoked when the promise is fulfilled (successfully resolved) or rejected (returning an error).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>.catch()</code> method is used with promises to handle errors that occur with asynchronous operations. It&#8217;s used to define a callback function that will be invoked when a promise is rejected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in the above example, a <code>fetch()</code> request is made and then two <code>.then()</code> actions are chained together. The first takes the API response and converts it to JSON. The second then takes that JSON data and logs it to the console. But why is this data called &#8220;response&#8221; in the first line and then &#8220;data&#8221; in the next? It&#8217;s because <code>.json()</code> ALSO returns a promise! It takes in &#8220;response&#8217; and returns something else &#8211; in this case: &#8220;data&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can call the responses from the <code>fetch()</code> request and the <code>.json()</code> method anything we want, but a common convention is to call the data received from a <code>fetch()</code> request &#8220;response&#8221; and to call the data that was converted by <code>.json()</code> &#8220;data&#8221;. This would be equally acceptable, but it doesn&#8217;t follow convention:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>fetch(\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\")<br>    .then(doggyData =&gt; doggyData.json())<br>    .then(doggyJson =&gt; console.log(doggyJson))<br>    .catch(error =&gt; console.error('Error:', error))</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting that most people don&#8217;t consider renaming the data in the callback function inside of the <code>.catch()</code> anything but &#8220;error&#8221;. If it ain&#8217;t broke&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://dmitripavlutin.com/fetch-with-json/\">Dmitri Pavlutin: How to Use fetch() with JSON</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch\">w3schools: Using the Fetch API</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drK6mdA9d_M\">YouTube: The Net Ninja: Asynchronous JavaScript Tutorial #9 &#8211; The Fetch API</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Async / Await</h2>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>async function logDog() {<br>    const response = await fetch(\"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\")<br>    const jsonData = await response.json()<br>    console.log(jsonData)<br>}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The above code is the <strong>async/await</strong> equivalent of the promise chaining example from the previous section. The <strong>async</strong> keyword can be used to change any function into an asynchronous one that returns a promise. Any value returned by the function is wrapped in a resolved promise. <strong>await</strong> is used on the actual command that returns a promise, causing JavaScript to act synchronously and wait for the promise to resolve. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><code>await</code> can only be used inside of an <code>async</code> function</li>\n\n\n\n<li>It causes the function to pause and wait for a resolved promise before continuing</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that in this basic example, we&#8217;re not handling any errors (rejected promises) from the API. However, in this <code>async</code> version, <strong>response</strong> and <strong>jsonData</strong> are variables. This means that they can be manipulated like any other JavaScript variables. <code>fetch()</code> doesn&#8217;t allow for direct saving and manipulation in the same manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in the above example, the <strong>logDog()</strong> function is made asynchronous via the <strong>async</strong> keyword. Then the <code>fetch()</code> request is then made and its (hopefully successful) response is saved to a variable called &#8220;response&#8221;. That response data is then converted into JSON and saved to another variable called &#8220;jsonData&#8221;. Finally, the JSON object is logged to the console.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function\">MDN async function</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_async.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Async</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://javascript.info/async-await\">javascript.info Async/await</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Waiting&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But &#8211; if a <code>fetch()</code> request returns a promise, and if <code>.json()</code> also returns a promise &#8211; why are we prefacing them with the <code>await</code> keyword? Isn&#8217;t that redundant?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In JavaScript, the <code>await</code> keyword is used to pause the execution of an <code>async</code> function until a promise is resolved. It doesn&#8217;t make the promise itself redundant &#8211; it allows you to work with promises in a more synchronous manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though both <code>fetch()</code> and <code>.json()</code> return promises, using <code>await</code> ensures that the code <em>waits for the promises to resolve</em> before proceeding. Without <code>await</code>, the subsequent lines of code would execute immediately after the promises are created. This can lead to &#8220;race conditions&#8221; or incorrect program behavior.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Comparison</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are the benefits of using <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> versus <code>fetch()</code> with promise chaining? They mainly differ in terms of coding style and readability. Both approaches achieve the same result but offer different syntaxes for handling asynchronous operations. Some considerations include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Readability: Some developers find async/await more readable and easier to understand, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Error handling: async/await allows use of try/catch blocks for error handling, making it similar to synchronous error handling. With .then() chaining, error handling is typically done using .catch() at the end of the chain.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Chaining: With .then() chaining, its easy to chain multiple asynchronous operations together, which can be more concise than using async/await. (Note that error handling wasn&#8217;t incorporated into the async/await function!)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Compatibility: async/await might not be available in older browsers. fetch() with .then() is more widely supported.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Both approaches achieve the same result &#8211; fetching data from the API and logging it to the console. The choice between them comes down to personal preference, team conventions, and project requirements.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day.

participated in my second <strong>Tech Forum: Rancho Cucamonga</strong> meetup, an event that impresses me with its tapestry of participants spanning diverse industries and career trajectories. Unlike meetups which are often confined to the realm of programming, this gathering serves as a dynamic convergence point for individuals boasting multifaceted backgrounds and expertise.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This session, led by<strong> Mureed Zafr</strong>, a senior developer at <strong>Walt Disney</strong> who I think also worked at <strong>Paramount</strong>, shed light on the intersection of AI and movie industry practices. Titled <strong>&#8220;How It Works: Studio Technology</strong>,&#8221; Zafr&#8217;s discourse explored innovations in the utilization of AI in parsing movie scripts and leveraging metadata to streamline the optioning process for cinematic properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zafr went over the processes involved in taking a movie script from idea to screenplay. There were many layers involved, but focus was placed on the role of readers, whose job it is to review scripts and critique them in search of those with the strongest potential for success at the box office and on screenplay editing, a process which a prospective title could undergo a surprising number of times to strengthen its pace, flow, dialogue and more. Live-action screenplays could be revised several dozen times, whereas animated titles could endure hundreds of rewrites! Issues were brought up about property rights &#8211; like who owns a script and how much of it (depending on the percentage of that person’s contributions), whose names appear on onscreen credits, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" data-attachment-id=\"2559\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/rancho-2024-02-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,865\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1706952462&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0083333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rancho-2024-02-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2559\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-01.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Hello world</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, the process of reading and refining screenplays has been labor-intensive and manual. Individuals were tasked with reviewing pages of content, identifying errors, ensuring consistency in tone, scrutinizing dialogue, and managing a multitude of other things that I’m not familiar with. Often, these tasks were repeated numerous times before the screenplay could progress to the next phase. This was done on paper, by human hands, with pen and ink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of computerization prompted studios to establish standardized digital formats for screenplays, likely building upon pre-existing formats found in software like <strong>Final Draft</strong>, which itself evolved from earlier manual typewritten conventions. This standardization led to the embedding of metadata into screenplay files, maybe in JSON or XML formats, laying the groundwork for the integration of AI into the studio landscape. Leveraging metadata and script text, AI algorithms can now be trained to dissect screenplays for a variety of practical and insightful purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" data-attachment-id=\"2561\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/rancho-2024-02-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,865\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1706958353&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0083333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rancho-2024-02-02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2561\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-02.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reading with real voices</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Utilizing metadata, AI technology has the capability to analyze a screenplay and vocalize it through computer-generated voices. This metadata includes details that provide emotional context, enabling the AI to replicate human-like expressions such as screaming, shouting, pausing, and even conveying tears, thereby articulating scenes similarly to how a human might. Essentially, this process mirrors voice acting but through digital agents, offering a novel approach to script interpretation. Furthermore, it&#8217;s possible to have the script narrated in a specific emulated voice. Zafr gave examples such as reading dialogue in the voices of <strong>Samuel L. Jackson</strong>, <strong>Patrick Stewart</strong>, and <strong>Jennifer Aniston</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Mocking scenes with animation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Expanding beyond auditory output, AI possesses the capacity to generate animated scenes in diverse styles, effectively crafting animated storyboards that bring scenes to life. Metadata again plays a pivotal role in enabling this. Taking this a step further, it&#8217;s possible that these two abilities alone &#8211; emulating voices and other sound effects, alongside generating animated scenes &#8211; could allow studios to sidestep real-world expenses associated with scene mocking and dry runs. This holds the potential to allow the creation of entire movies or series through AI-driven processes, empowering individuals and independent studios to develop their own intellectual properties with greater ease and efficiency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve already watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI-DQ1OxRzY\">music videos</a> which had their video elements generated by AI.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" data-attachment-id=\"2565\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/rancho-2024-02-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,865\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1706958796&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;200&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0083333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rancho-2024-02-04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2565\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-04.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Refining dialogue</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some human readers specialize in editing dialogue to make sure that it sounds authentic to the people and places being portrayed onscreen. Examples that were brought up included accents and word choices from different places in the US (I think Detroit was mentioned). Consider how someone from New York doesn’t sound like a Texan, and neither sound like Californians from The Valley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apparently, AI can be trained to use metadata and dialogue samples to patternize how people from different places sound and can compare this with dialogue in a screenplay to suggest changes more in-line with what it determines people from that area should sound like. It’s essentially leveraging natural language processing for dialogue revision. AI can even use this data to analyze sentiment for tone and determine character consistency via their dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, with regard to international productions or localization, AI-powered language translation tools can assist in translating dialogue from one language to another while preserving the nuances and cultural context of the original script.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Predicting audience engagement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI tools can predict how audiences might respond to different lines of dialogue based on historical data, target audience demographic information, social media trends and other data. This predictive analysis can inform revisions to dialogue to maximize audience engagement and satisfaction. Character stereotypes, political correctness, triggering scenes and words &#8211; all of these can be toned down or leaned into, depending on the studio’s desire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the audience members, a person who teaches business at a college in California but also works for <strong>Netflix India</strong> made some comparisons between how <strong>Netflix</strong> determines script potential vs how Zafr described the process that the studios he worked for utilized. Netflix seemed to be more data-driven in their approach, especially by monitoring social media and review platforms to gauge audience sentiment towards upcoming movies. This contrasted with the American studios which could have recommendations overridden by studio executives based on their individual tastes. It occurred to me that this partially explained how some movies simply failed at internal consistency or realism, even with critical readers (and now, with AI readers) dissecting their scripts and pointing out flaws.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"461\" height=\"1023\" data-attachment-id=\"2564\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/rancho-2024-02-05/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"865,1920\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1706958928&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0083333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rancho-2024-02-05\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=135\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=461\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=461\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2564\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=461 461w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=68 68w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=135 135w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-05.jpg 865w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 461px) 100vw, 461px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Identity explored on a deeper level, who owns their image and identity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the final topics brought up at the meetup was the exploration of identity and how it takes on a profound dimension when considering the implications of AI&#8217;s ability to simulate a person&#8217;s likeness and use it in a movie. This raises significant questions about ownership of one&#8217;s image and identity in an era where technology blurs the lines between reality and simulation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditionally, actors and public figures have had some degree of control over how their image is used, but the advent of AI challenges this paradigm. Should individuals have the right to control the use of their digital likeness, even if it&#8217;s generated by AI? The ethical implications of using AI-generated likenesses in movies extend beyond questions of ownership. Is it ethical to use someone&#8217;s likeness without their consent, even if it&#8217;s created by AI? Although I haven’t seen it, some audience members brought up a recent episode in which someone used AI to generate explicit photos of <strong>Taylor Swift</strong>. What about deceased individuals whose likenesses are recreated for historical or entertainment purposes? I remember reading an article a few years ago about using computer-generated likenesses to bring actors like <strong>Bruce Lee</strong> and <strong>Charles Bronson</strong> back to share the screen with actors living today. What could <strong>The Expendables</strong> look like with access to all of the tough guys and ladies of the ages?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking a step further out from a person’s digital likeness &#8211; does any of this accurately represent their identity? Can AI capture the nuances of human expression and emotion and truly recreate a semblance of that person’s persona or is this just a collection of data points run through an algorithm? Is the net effect different either way?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Security</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, stepping away from the philosophical meanderings about identity, the topic of property security came up. I don’t remember all of the specifics, especially after the brain dump that I just took on a week after the meetup, but I remember DRM (digital rights management) being brought up at the talk. One of the attendees is the person who digitally encoded the first 500 properties that <strong>Sony</strong> (I think) released on DVD in the mid 90s. Through dialogue between him and Zafr, we learned that AI is even being used now to protect studio content via analysis of digital fingerprints and metadata to track down leaked videos and protect intellectual property and even alter scripts given to cast members to prevent potential spoilers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"461\" data-attachment-id=\"2562\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/02/09/rancho-cucamonga-meetup-how-it-works-studio-technology-mureed-zafr/rancho-2024-02-06/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,865\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;1.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1706959108&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.4&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;40&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.0083333333333333&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"rancho-2024-02-06\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2562\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/rancho-2024-02-06.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The intersection of AI and the movie industry represents a landscape of innovation and adaptation that I was completely unaware of prior to this meetup. From script revisions to audience engagement predictions, AI reshapes the way films are conceptualized, produced, and distributed. As it evolves, AI plays a growing role in addressing ethical considerations, safeguarding intellectual property, and enhancing security measures. However, it also brings its own challenges surrounding identity, privacy, and content ownership. It will be interesting to see what content creation looks like a decade from now, when this technology is more refined and widespread, and what we look like as both producers and consumers of this content.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Last weekend, I participated in my second Tech Forum: Rancho Cucamonga meetup, an event that impresses me with its tapestry of participants spanning diverse industries and career trajectories.

basics of working with CSV files in JavaScript","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/23/the-basics-of-working-with-csv-files-in-javascript/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-EV","content":"\n<p>I’m on the job hunt and have been interviewing recently. Due to the current market, I recently added <strong>QA Engineer</strong> roles to my search, expanding from front-end, back-end and full-stack web developer positions. Last week, I was referred to a QA Engineer position by someone who graduated from the same bootcamp as me. There was a take-home assignment to complete. Part of the assignment involved using <strong>Microsoft Playwright</strong>, a testing, automation and web-scraping library. It was my first brush with Playwright, and with automation. I found it really interesting and I’m excited to learn more about automation and web-scraping &#8211; but I’ll get into that in another post once I’ve delved into both more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the tasks was to scrape a news aggregator website using Playwright, get a list of the top 10 articles from it and save the titles and URLs of those articles to a<strong> CSV file</strong>. I’ve actually never used JavaScript to do this, so I learned the basics of the process on the fly through a combination of Googling and <strong>ChatGPT</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used Playwright in <strong>Node</strong>, so it had access to the local file system. Browsers don’t generally have access to the local file system as a security measure to protect against malicious activity. I believe that they can gain access in a limited manner using the <strong>FileReader API</strong>, but it’s somewhat locked down. Node has access to all of the file system that the OS and user permissions allow. It can read and write files, work with directories and do all of the typical tasks that working with the file system entails.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overview</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with CSV files generally involves reading and writing data using CSV (Comma Separated Values) format. The data in the files is separated into rows and data in each row are separated by commas. It can look like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\" style=\"line-height:1.1\"><code>Title,URL\r<br>January 2024 Update: Networking,https://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/\r<br>November 2023 Update,https://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/\r<br>JavaScript’s Date() setInterval() and style property,https://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/13/javascripts-date-setinterval-and-style-property/</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The first row contains header information &#8211; essentially the names of the columns. Subsequent rows have the actual data, with one entry per row or line.Each piece of data in a row is separated using a comma with no spaces in-between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These files are easily readable by spreadsheets. Growing up, I always saw them being opened using <strong>MS Excel</strong>, but now <strong>Google Sheets</strong>, <strong>LibreOffice</strong> and other applications exist that can be used to view and work with them. Opening a CSV file in a spreadsheet program displays the data using rows and columns, like any other spreadsheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/-2ZibhhiiVYWTmP0yZFUURdX7nftA5y8Pwm7iziRnySZ96Dm25ovklYwiA6Y1SSOjos2tP24tRn_AZ0yUco1l-zHIBIa8phjmkoSJlusNJdTOTEweVytIChD3DOS6HjS8WlUr8HCicZdsObkgObunYc\" alt=\"\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>There are JavaScript libraries available to read from and write to CSV files. I wanted to avoid importing libraries and focus on using fundamental JavaScript methods to work with CSV files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Creating and writing to a CSV file</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>To begin, import “<strong>fs</strong>” into the JavaScript file like this: const fs = require(&#8220;fs&#8221;)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>fs is the built-in <strong>file system</strong> module in Node. It will be used to perform the file operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assemble data to save to a CSV file. All that’s needed is an array of arrays. The way that I did it for the assignment was to scrape an area of the assigned website for links and create an array that saved the title (innerText) and URL (href) to an array. During the scraping process, I used another piece of data to filter through the links to make sure that they were indeed articles and not links to other things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to that, when I was testing, I used a hard-coded array with completely different data (name, age, city). The important thing is that you have an array of arrays, like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\" style=\"line-height:1.1\"><code>const csvData = &#091;\r<br>    &#091;'Name', 'Age', 'City'],\r<br>    &#091;'Vish', 48, 'New York'],\r<br>    &#091;'Tsu', 55, 'Los Angeles'],\r<br>    &#091;'Mika', 6, 'Chino Hills']\r<br>]\r</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Each array in the example above will be transformed into a row of data in the CSV file. When you have the array of data, then the CSV file can be created. This is the process I used:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\" style=\"line-height:1.1\"><code>function createCSV(data) {\r<br>    // convert data to csv string\r<br>    function convertToCSV(data) {\r<br>        const csvArray = &#091;&#091;\"Title\", \"URL\"],]\r<br>\r<br>        data.forEach(row =&gt; {\r<br>            csvArray.push(row.join(','))\r<br>        })\r<br>\r<br>        return csvArray.join('\\n')\r<br>    }\r<br>\r<br>    const csvString = convertToCSV(data)\r<br>\r<br>    // filename for csv (will save in root of project folder)\r<br>    const csvFile = \"top-ten.csv\"\r<br>\r<br>    // write to file\r<br>    fs.writeFileSync(csvFile, csvString, \"utf-8\")\r<br>\r<br>    console.log(\"CSV file created at: \", csvFile )\r<br>}\r<br></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, <strong>createCSV()</strong> takes in data, which is the array of arrays that was created earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A function is defined inside of <strong>createCSV()</strong> called <strong>convertToCSV()</strong> that will actually do the work of building the file\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An array is initialized in it called <strong>csvArray</strong> with a single row of data in the form of another array that has two strings in it that will become the column headers.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Below this function, a const called <strong>csvString</strong> is declared to contain the CSV data. It passes the array that <strong>createCSV()</strong> took to <strong>convertToCSV()</strong> and stores the returned response.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Another const called <strong>csvFile</strong> is declared to save the CSV’s filename.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now we use <strong>fs</strong>, which was imported at the top of the file, along with a method called <strong>writeFileSync()</strong> to save the data from <strong>csvString</strong> to the local hard drive. It takes in 3 arguments:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The file name</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The data to be saved</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The encoding format (“utf-8”)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>I then logged the file name to the console so that the viewer can see the name of the file. fs saves it in the same directory that the JavaScript file is run from, unless a different directory is named in the arguments it received.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s it. We passed the array of arrays to the function, which then pushed each row onto its own line and separated the values in the subarray using commas. That chunk of data is saved to a variable. The variable’s data is then saved on the local file system using a name that we specify in the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a little hard to follow the first time doing it, but it gets easier once the process is understood. The file should be saved in the same folder that the JavaScript file was run from (unless a different folder was specified in the file path when saving. Open it to see its contents. Look at it using a text editor like Notepad and a spreadsheet application.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reading from a CSV file</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I was able to successfully create and save a CSV file, I wanted to see how to read from it, because I’ve already read data from localStorage, SQL databases and Firebase but I’ve somehow never read from local files using JavaScript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To do this, I created another function called <strong>readCSV()</strong>. It takes in a file as its argument. It then uses <strong>fs</strong> to read the file from its location in the file system, parses the data and logs it to the console. This is how the function looked:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code has-small-font-size\" style=\"line-height:1.1\"><code>function readCSV(filename) {\r<br>    // Read the CSV file\r<br>    fs.readFile(filename, 'utf8', (err, data) =&gt; {\r<br>        if (err) {\r<br>            console.error('Error reading CSV file:', err)\r<br>            return\r<br>        }\r<br>\r<br>        // Parse CSV data\r<br>        const rows = data.split('\\n')\r<br>        const headers = rows&#091;0].split(',')\r<br>\r<br>        const results = rows.slice(1).map(row =&gt; {\r<br>            const values = row.split(',')\r<br>            return headers.reduce((obj, header, index) =&gt; {\r<br>                obj&#091;header.trim()] = values&#091;index].trim()\r<br>                return obj\r<br>            }, {})\r<br>        })\r<br>\r<br>        // Display the contents of the CSV file\r<br>        console.log(\"\\x1b&#091;33m\"+\"\\n-+- TOP TEN ARTICLES FROM HACKER NEWS -+- \\n\"+\"\\x1b&#091;0m\")\r<br>\r<br>        results.forEach(result =&gt; {\r<br>            console.log(\"Title: \", result.Title)\r<br>            console.log(\"URL:   \", result.URL, \"\\n\")\r<br>        })\r<br>\r<br>        console.log(\"\\x1b&#091;31m\"+\"\\nCancel this process and return to the terminal by pressing CONTROL-C\"+\"\\x1b&#091;0m\")\r<br>    })\r<br>}\r<br></code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In the above code, <strong>readCSV()</strong> takes in the CSV file that was saved.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>It calls <strong>fs</strong> with the <strong>readFile()</strong> method to load the contents of the file. <strong>readFile()</strong> takes in the file name, the encoding type (“utf8”) and a calls a callback function with two arguments:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>err</strong> to handle any errors loading the file </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>data</strong> to hold the file contents</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Next, the contents of the CSV file are parsed:\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A const called <strong>rows</strong> is declared, which takes the <strong>data</strong> from <strong>fs.readFile()</strong> and splits it wherever a new line character (“<strong>\\n</strong>”) is found</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A const called <strong>headers</strong> is declared that takes the first row in the file (row 0) and splits it into an array of values wherever it finds a comma\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>These headers will be used as keys when creating objects for each of the other rows of data</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Rows are now mapped to objects in the <strong>results</strong> const.\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>slice(1)</strong> tells Node to exclude the first row (headers) of the <strong>rows</strong> array</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>map()</strong> then iterates over the rest of the rows and creates an object for each one\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>For each row, the row values are <strong>split()</strong> into an array (“<strong>values</strong>”) wherever a comma is found</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>reduce()</strong> is used to create an object (“<strong>obj</strong>”) that uses the headers as keys and the values as the values</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>These values are then returned to <strong>results</strong></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally the results are logged to the console. Logging them normally shows an array of objects. I formatted the output for readability using new lines and some text colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a very basic process using only Node/JavaScript and no libraries. There are many full-fledged libraries that provide methods to create and read from CSV files.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Resources</h1>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_API\">MDN: File System API</a> (for the terminal / Node)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader\">MDN: File Reader API</a> (for the browser / JavaScript)</li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>I’m on the job hunt and have been interviewing recently.

New Year, anyway. I had some things that I wanted to write about last month, but I couldn&#8217;t. For some reason, WordPress suspended my coding blog in December. There was a link to a message in my dashboard that was supposed to have details, but it just took me to their terms of service with no indication of what the breach was. I appealed it when I saw it and finally, a few days ago, I found that the site was available to be viewed again. There was no follow-up message to explain what the root of the issue was and no message to let me know when the site was restored, so I don&#8217;t know how to prevent it from happening again.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-4 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"819\" data-attachment-id=\"2482\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/wp-redo-1a/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1093,875\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"wp-redo-1a\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2482\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2482\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-1a.jpg 1093w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"817\" data-attachment-id=\"2483\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/wp-redo-2a/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1093,873\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"wp-redo-2a\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2483\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2483\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/wp-redo-2a.jpg 1093w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving on from that though, I&#8217;ve been networking and going to meetups and events whenever I can. It&#8217;s been a lot of fun meeting people and learning about what brought them to coding or tech in general. Here are some updates:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Learn Teach Code</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been attending the <strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learnteachcode/\">Learn Teach Code</a></strong> meetups in Koreatown when I can. Since the <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/\">first time that I went</a> in November last year, I&#8217;ve been there 5 times. The first one was at <strong><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anjuhouse/?hl=en\">Anju House</a></strong>, a Korean restaurant, but all of the subsequent ones have been at <strong><a href=\"https://g.co/kgs/vZJgUzz\">Cafe Loft</a></strong>, which is their usual location. Anju House was their alternate when Cafe Loft was being renovated. I&#8217;ve also been more active on their <strong>Discord</strong> server. It&#8217;s a good way to keep in touch with people who I&#8217;ve met there while not at the meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped

2nd session for the new year. I missed the first one (Jan 4th) because I was with family, and apparently there was a huge turnout. They filled the room that they usually reserve and had to send more people upstairs. There were around 30 attendees. Last week&#8217;s session had about a dozen people. A few were first-timers and had interesting backgrounds. I spoke with one for a while about his interest in <strong>augmented reality</strong>. He&#8217;s currently doing back-end work in <strong>Go</strong> and is learning <strong>Rust</strong>. There was another who was interested in bootcamps. I can&#8217;t remember which one he&#8217;s enrolled in &#8211; it might have been <strong><a href=\"https://www.galvanize.com/hack-reactor/\">Hack Reactor</a></strong>. I told him about my experience at <strong>Lambda</strong> (now <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomtech.com/\">Bloom Institute of Technology</a></strong>) and we talked about <strong><a href=\"https://leonnoel.com/100devs/\">100Devs</a></strong> since I went through their <strong>Huntober</strong> event (which lasted until Christmas). He and another person who I hadn&#8217;t met before had questions about the experience and curriculum. I also let them know about <strong><a href=\"https://www.resilientcoders.org/\">Resilient Coders</a></strong>, which is the bootcamp that Leon from 100Devs teaches at professionally. A lot of Resilient Coders material makes it&#8217;s way into 100Devs and some RC staff assist at 100Devs with career advisement.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-6 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" data-attachment-id=\"2489\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/cafe-loft-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1705002194&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;1.74&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2500&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.05&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cafe-loft-01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2489\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2489\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-01.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" data-attachment-id=\"2490\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/cafe-loft-02-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1705002559&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;1.74&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;2000&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.041666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"cafe-loft-02-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2490\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2490\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/cafe-loft-02-1.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n</figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tech Forum: Rancho Cucamonga</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last weekend (Jan 6th), I also attended a tech meetup in Rancho Cucamonga called (appropriately enough) <strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/tech-forum-rancho-cucamonga/\">Tech Forum: Rancho Cucamonga</a></strong>.

One of them is a director at <strong><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/\">Stack Overflow</a></strong>. The speaker has a background in industrial and product design and has designed products for large companies like <strong>Gilette</strong>, including products that generated billions of dollars for them. Two of the attendees were a pair of women who owned a company that consulted to other firms around some kind of information design. Some of the engineers also programmed the devices that they designed &#8211; they built a lot of hardware including working with circuit boards and the like and had been doing it since the 70s and 80s. They&#8217;re like the <strong>Steve Wozniak</strong> generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tech Forum met in a co-working space called<a href=\"https://www.foundrspace.com/rancho\"> <strong>FoundrSpace</strong></a>. It was my first time at one of these places and I was impressed with the environment. There were desks centralized in the main room that were wide enough for people to have personal space yet still converse with each other if desired. There&#8217;s coffee available from one of the local companies from Rancho who have apparently grown to a size that they ship internationally now. There was free beer on tap, and the coffee company and co-working space paid for breakfast which included an assortment of hot sandwiches, donuts and yogurts. One of the sponsors was the host&#8217;s application development company.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-8 is-layout-flex

This was their 4th session and the theme was about <strong>design thinking</strong>. I believe the three previous sessions focused on different aspects of AI. The speaker&#8217;s name was <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/craig-provost-5b35167/\">Craig Provost</a></strong>. He&#8217;s an industrial &amp; product designer who also teaches about &#8220;Design Thinking, Live Facilitation, Design Strategy, Customer/User Research, Industrial Design, Branding/Messaging, Creativity Workshops, and Graphic Recording&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the term design thinking before, but I&#8217;ve applied some of it&#8217;s principles when working at the EMR that made up the bulk of my career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Craig&#8217;s session was engaging and geared towards getting a feel for the attendees&#8217; accomplishments and misses from the past year and their goals for the new one. He polled the audience via questions that were answered with raised hands and asked questions that were answered on sticky notes which were collected onto larger sheets so that we could see the collected thoughts and use them for conversation and networking with each other. Some of the polls included asking about tools that attendees had used for communication during the past year, their goals for the new year, what new technologies had made an impact on their lives over the past year, any skills or technologies that they planned on learning during this year, activities that they planned on engaging in during the new year and predictions (challenges and opportunities) for 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__gallery\"><div class=\"tiled-gallery__row\"><div

some interesting conversations about user interfaces, hardware design, the job hunt, working with non-profits, programming and a few other things. The interface discussion was really interesting. There were initially two people who brought up different things, one was about the next evolution of user interfaces, which he was very interested in, and the other was about AI. I remember him saying that he didn&#8217;t think that the next interface would be as radical as reducing dashboards down to a single prompt for input, which is similar to how we currently interact with technologies like <strong>ChatGPT</strong>, and I explained the concept of the PAN (personal area network) to him. It&#8217;s something I first read about about 20 years ago: a network that follows the individual and syncs that person&#8217;s devices and data to the individual. Right now, smartphones might be the closest representation of what it might contain. I thought that it could be combined with AI and dashboards to result in a richer UI of sorts, and he was interested in moving away from screens, which dovetailed the ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I plan on going to more of these meetups, as the attendee base is very different from the programmer ones and brings really interesting ideas and perspectives with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Google DevFest</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month (Dec 15th), I went to <strong><a href=\"https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-los-angeles-presents-devfest-2023-greater-los-angeles/\">Google DevFest</a></strong> in West Hollywood (Plummer Park). It&#8217;s essentially a conference sponsored by Google that&#8217;s similar in makeup to the event I went to in Rancho. The scale is a bit larger, with more attendees and speakers though. There were two areas with different tracks, one for students and one for professionals. Each track hosted a set of presenters who spoke about different topics. I went to the room that hosted the pro track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met up with a few people who attend the <strong>Learn Teach Code</strong> meetups in Koreatown &#8211; but I didn&#8217;t know they&#8217;d be there initially. I also met up with a friend from <strong>100Devs</strong> who I&#8217;d been speaking with on Discord and who I subsequently introduced to the LTC people here and who then joined me at LTC meetups after and at the <strong>Tech Forum: Rancho Cucamonga</strong> meetup. This was his first event and our first time meeting each other. We&#8217;ve attended a few networking events together since then.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-9 is-layout-flex

missed the presentation on &#8220;Integrating Visual Communication &amp; Storytelling&#8221;. I saw about half of the &#8220;Build Your Own GenAI Model&#8221; presentation and then sat for &#8220;3 Habits to Supercharge Your Career Growth&#8221; by <strong>Michelle Brenner</strong>, who I chatted with for a few minutes when her presentation was over. I had previously heard her speak a little at an online meetup that I attended earlier in the month that was co-hosted by <strong>Learn Teach Code LA</strong> and <strong>Women Who Code LA</strong>, so I was interested in seeing her live. I didn&#8217;t get to go to her breakout room during the online event because there were a lot of speakers in different rooms at the same time and I had started in another room and remained there for a very long time, but I&#8217;m attending again when they have another session this month, so maybe I&#8217;ll get to hear her speak in more depth at that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Google DevFest and the collaborative online meetup between LTC and WWC used a structure in which speakers presented at the same time in different areas. I&#8217;ve found that  I prefer a different format in which only one presentation happens at a time because  I want to see <em>all</em> of the speakers and find myself missing out. In that regard, l like the  meetup in Rancho which brings speakers up one at a time for the entire audience. They&#8217;re all beneficial though.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Virtual Monthly Mentorship Mixer (Learn Teach Code &amp; Women Who Code LA)</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" data-attachment-id=\"2531\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2024/01/14/january-2024-update-networking/ltc-wwc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp\" data-orig-size=\"600,338\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"ltc-wwc\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp?w=600\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp?w=600\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2531\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp 600w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ltc-wwc.webp?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As mentioned in the previous section, a few days before Google DevFest (Dec 12th) I attended an <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learnteachcode/events/297758676/\">online collaborative event</a> between Learn Teach Code and Women Who Code LA. It&#8217;s apparently a monthly event hosted on Zoom. There are a lot of speakers who each have their own breakout room and attendees are free to join any that they&#8217;re interested in and jump from room-to-room. This is the event in which I came across Michelle Brenner, who I later saw and spoke with at DevFest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mentorship mixer focuses on smaller groups with more direct conversation with mentors in different areas in tech. A lot of it is career-focused, which really appealed to me as I&#8217;m currently on the job hunt. It&#8217;s beginner-friendly as well. This session&#8217;s list of mentors and topics included the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Michelle Brenner</strong> (Senior Software Engineer) &#8211; Career advice, conference speaking, Netflix</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Skawn Koski</strong> (Frontend Developer) &#8211; JavaScript, React, CSS questions, job search and resume advice</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Wai-Yin Kwan</strong> (Software Engineer) &#8211; Changing careers from a non-tech background, bootcamps vs. self-learning, tech careers in non-tech-bro world, diversity in tech</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Lydia Yeung</strong> (Senior Recruiter) &#8211; Recruiting Q&amp;A, resume review, interviewing, offers, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Liz Krane</strong> (Software Developer &#8211; and founder of LTC) &#8211; Self-taught career changing, JavaScript, functional languages, meetups, networking, public speaking, burnout, neurodiversity</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keri Medeiros</strong> (Support Engineer) &#8211; Working at a startup vs. big tech, changing careers from a non-tech background, support engineering, ecommerce, remote work, networking remotely</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Jenny Spadoni</strong> (Software Engineer) &#8211; Bootcamps vs. self-taught developer paths, big tech apprenticeships, imposter syndrome, soft skills</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>CJ</strong> (Software Engineer) &#8211; Transition into tech, motivation, DEI, startups, FAANG interview preparation</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>EAN</strong> (Senior Software Engineer) &#8211; Game development, self-taught vs. bootcamp vs. academia tradeoffs and approaches</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Andy LoPresto</strong> (VP of Security) &#8211; Interviewing, hiring, startups vs. big tech, managing teams, open source software, security</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There were also some backup mentors who moved about into different rooms:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Stephen Kwok</strong> (Bioinformatician and Data Scientist) &#8211; Data science, data analytics, AI/ML, bioinformatics, working in biotech, transitioning from academia to industry</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Gary Cheung</strong> (Software Engineer) &#8211; DevOps, prompt engineering, work-life balance, working as a new parent, remote work, becoming a high-performer, financial health, mental health, industry certifications, education and degrees</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Ramiro Herrera</strong> (Software Engineer, Senior Java Developer) &#8211; Working at enterprise companies, career advice</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Nicole Chow</strong> (Senior Software Engineer) &#8211; her topics weren&#8217;t listed</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There were a little more than 40 people at this event. After introductions, people broke out into smaller groups in breakout rooms. I was in <strong>Shawn Koski</strong>&#8216;s room for the bulk of the session because he spoke about the job hunt and resumes and had JavaScript, React and CSS listed, which are key technologies that I make use of. I had originally intended to move from room-to-room and network as well as get an idea of what each speaker was sharing, but instead, I found myself in deeper conversations with Shawn and the other people in the room. Some people did leave the room to explore others, and new people joined this one, so there was a dynamic mix of people the majority of the time. I had wanted to go to every room though because all of them spoke about career topics that interested me. I&#8217;ll see what happens next time, but I imagine that something similar will occur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did network a bit and connect with a few people from this event on LinkedIn. Some of them have had lengthy conversations with me about their job search, their backgrounds and general career advice. I enjoy it, but over time it does turn into a large time investment, especially when speaking with multiple people. It&#8217;s fun though, and also provides some benefits to mental health. It&#8217;s reassuring to be able to speak with people who are in similar situations and have similar experiences to me in tech.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Online Meetups and Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting to me how bits of one event can bleed into another. When I attended the collaborative <strong><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learnteachcode/events/297758676/\">Virtual Monthly Mentorship Mixer</a></strong> between Learn Teach Code and Women Who Code LA, I came across Michelle Brenner, who I then met at Google DevFest. The 100Devs Discord put me in touch with a person who lives in Corona, which is close by to where I am. I chatted with him for a week or two and found that he&#8217;s also in Learn Teach Code but had never attended a meetup. So, I invited him to meet at Google DevFest, which we did, and then I ran into other members of Learn Teach Code there and introduced him to them. He stayed and spoke with them when I left to get my kids. We&#8217;ve done a bit of collaborative coding since and shared resources &#8211; including his referring me to someone who interviewed me for an ecommerce position. He and I then met at the event in Rancho Cucamonga.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At last week&#8217;s Learn Teach Code meetup, when I spoke to one of the new people about augmented reality, I brought up the user interface conversation that I&#8217;d had at Rancho. It struck me that augmented reality could be combined with personal area networks, dashboards and AI to combine into exactly what the person who I spoke with at Rancho was looking for. I mean to bring that up to him if I see him at the next meetup. The cross-pollination of ideas really appeals to me at these venues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also finding that networking has a huge impact on the job hunt, which is something that I&#8217;ll probably talk about a little in another post. This one has grown too long to tack on more material already. But, in a nutshell, speaking to people online and then meeting them IRL, having commonalities with them and helping them when I can has opened doors that I wouldn&#8217;t otherwise have had access to. I&#8217;m in the midst of preparing for another interview this week due to reaching out and speaking with another person. There&#8217;s this idea that programmers are introverts and night owls who stay up in the dark and only come alive behind computer screens when they&#8217;re staring at arcane lines of code and coaxing indecipherable responses out of their machines. I&#8217;ve found that this really isn&#8217;t the case, and that there&#8217;s such a breadth of variety in what brings people to tech (and coding) and what their skills and experiences are from their past lives in other fields. It&#8217;s fun that there are people who skew a little closer to the &#8220;hacker&#8221; stereotype that proliferates in media, too, though.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>We&#8217;re two weeks into 2024, but Happy New Year, anyway.

href=\"https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend\">Scrimba&#8217;s Frontend Developer Path</a>. I&#8217;m on the module right before the final one, <strong>Advanced React</strong>. I effectively have 1.5 modules left to finish before I&#8217;m done with it and can get the certificate. It&#8217;s taken me longer than I anticipated to finish the material because I&#8217;ve built a lot of personal projects while working through the curriculum. That&#8217;s the best way to learn. Family obligations also took time away from <a href=\"https://scrimba.com\">Scrimba</a>, sometimes for weeks at a time.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"499\" data-attachment-id=\"2457\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/scrimba-frontend-path/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1902,927\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"scrimba-frontend-path\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2457\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/scrimba-frontend-path.jpg 1902w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">100Devs Huntober</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I paused Scrimba at the beginning of October to join <a href=\"https://leonnoel.com/\">100Devs</a>&#8216; <strong>#Huntobe</strong>r event. It&#8217;s open to people who haven&#8217;t completed 100Devs&#8217; bootcamp. Currently, we&#8217;re in week 6 of it. <strong>Leon Noel</strong>, who runs 100Devs, decided to extend it for a few weeks because there&#8217;s material that he wants to share with the cohort that we didn&#8217;t cover in the scheduled month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really impressed with Huntober. The approach is completely different from<strong> Lambda</strong>&#8216;s (now <a href=\"https://www.bloomtech.com/\">BloomTech</a>). It&#8217;s extremely people-focused. Apart from learning how to code, Leon mandates that people in each cohort network. The biggest thing that he preaches is networking. You&#8217;re told to compile a list (called your Hit List) of 60 companies that you want to work with. For each of those companies, you have to network with 3 people who work there. And it&#8217;s not just sending a <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/vish213/\">LinkedIn</a> connection request and calling it a day if they accept it. You have to reach out to people at those companies, and at other spaces &#8211; engineers, hiring managers, people who you find interesting &#8211; and you build relationships. Chat with them. Get to know them. Become their friends. Show genuine interest in their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea is that people hire people who they like, which makes a lot of sense. Leon has said that it&#8217;s generally believed that the tech industry is a meritocracy. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s nepotistic, like everything else. It doesn&#8217;t matter how skilled a person is at writing code and solving algorithmic problems. If you don&#8217;t know people and they don&#8217;t like you and have an interest in helping you succeed, you&#8217;re not going to get the jobs that you want. So, network your way into the position that you&#8217;re after.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leon shares resources and gives advice on how to go about doing this constantly. Throughout Huntober, we did things that I hadn&#8217;t done at Lambda. We crafted a story about ourselves. It tells potential employers who we are and what we can bring to their company. We&#8217;re encouraged to explain how we&#8217;re the hero of our story. That story can become the summary on your resume, can go on your LinkedIn profile and becomes your elevator pitch. It&#8217;s not something I&#8217;d ever done before, and it was amazing to hear him talk to people who had little experience, no college degree, were career changers, thought that their experience wasn&#8217;t transferrable to developer roles and who were simply not confident with themselves. There were single mothers and people who had been out of the workforce for years and others who thought that they were ill-fits for software engineer roles. He spun their experiences into jaw-dropping stories. I wish we could have recorded them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After stories have been crafted, he has us work on our resumes using a format that he recommends that does well against ATS (applicant tracking software) and guides recruiters to the most salient information about us in the average 7 seconds that they spend glancing at our resumes. He talks about how to pass the &#8220;sniff test&#8221; to get sent to the next stage of interviews. Apart from format, there were a lot of tips shared about crafting resume bullets, and he frequently let people from the audience join him onstage and reviewed their resumes in real time, offering suggestions, criticisms and praise where warranted. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We started incorporating code challenges into the daily meetings. Some are an hour long, and others are 30 minutes. Sometimes, they stretch past the time that they were supposed to end. There are guest appearances by other speakers who are in the industry and who want to offer advice. This coming week, we&#8217;re going to focus on LinkedIn and get tips for building and fine-tuning our profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huntober is motivating. Leon talks to a lot of people with every session. He helps people with interview tips, with negotiating job offers and with other concerns that they&#8217;ve come across &#8211; like one woman who found herself getting solicited for dating by interviewers while out with them, which apparently has happened to several others who attended the meeting. He gives responses and ideas to a lot of different scenarios and is a font of knowledge about networking and building relationships that can be mined for job referrals. There&#8217;s salary negotiation advice, information about how to gain perks at different companies, and approaches on how to learn what will be asked by specific companies during different kinds of interviews &#8211; like behavioral or technical ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I plan on joining the #catch-up-crew at 100Devs and working through the material as much as I can, and then joining their next cohort in January 2024. There are a lot of other initiatives moving forward at the bootcamp &#8211; which is completely free. It&#8217;s simply amazing. I wish I had taken time to learn more about it and join it sooner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later this month, after Huntober ends, Leon is running a free crash course or bootcamp focused on freelancing. I look forward to that, because I&#8217;m certain it&#8217;ll give me insight into how to better run my freelancing LLC.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" data-attachment-id=\"2459\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/100devs-huntober/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"100devs-huntober\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2459\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/100devs-huntober.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tailwind</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This month, I started learning <a href=\"https://tailwindcss.com/\">Tailwind CSS</a>. I just completed my first project with it yesterday, based on a crash course from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ\">Brad Traversy</a>. It got me acquainted with the syntax for the system as well as how to set it up so that it can be used in a project and how to add my own CSS and my own customizations to the setup. My goal is to build at least one project every week with Tailwind, to really get hands-on experience using it. Then, I plan on redesigning both my portfolio and my LLC&#8217;s website and rebuilding them both using Tailwind alongside any custom CSS that I might need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike a lot of other developers, I actually <em>like</em> CSS. Switching from CSS to Tailwind is interesting to me because it works differently from how I&#8217;m used to working. I tend to follow the idea of &#8220;separation of concerns&#8221; when I build web projects. One requirement of this is that HTML and CSS go into their own, separate files. Tailwind does away with this by adding utility classes directly in HTML. Those classes equate to CSS. You&#8217;re not actually writing CSS. That gets generated by Tailwind in it&#8217;s own file, but your HTML elements often have lengthy strings of class names attached to them that correspond with individual CSS properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, the thought of this left a bad taste in my mouth, but after even this first project, I find that I can live with it. I&#8217;m interested in seeing how I feel about this at the end of the month, after gaining more experience with the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"554\" data-attachment-id=\"2461\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/tailwind-example/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,1040\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"tailwind-example\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2461\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/tailwind-example.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Networking</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, I went to my first in-person programmer meetup in Koreatown, in Los Angeles. I brought my friend Sue with me. We met members of <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/learnteachcode/\">Learn Teach Code LA</a> at a restaurant called <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anjuhouse\">Anju House</a> and spent around 5 or 6 hours talking to everyone. It was a lot of fun learning about everyone&#8217;s backgrounds and seeing who was working and who was on the job hunt and what brought them into tech. Anju House&#8217;s musubi appetizers are fantastic. You get 8 pieces for $10, and there&#8217;s enough in one order to feed both of my kids. We shared a pitcher of soju (mixed with some yogurt) which definitely played a part in making us more social and getting others at the table to talk. I joined their <strong>Discord</strong> earlier this week and plan on going back when I&#8217;m free. Several of the people at the table ended up connecting with me on LinkedIn and Instagram, and I&#8217;ve been chatting with some of them since.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"460\" data-attachment-id=\"2465\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/11/09/november-2023-update/anju-4/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1080,486\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.2&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;SM-G781U&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1697747964&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;1.74&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;1250&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.041666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"anju-4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2465\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/anju-4.jpg 1080w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In-person networking seems to be effective, and it&#8217;s fun, too. I know some people have anxiety about meeting others, both online and in the flesh, but I think that the right group of people can really help alleviate the nervousness associated with that. This group is one of them. There were some really insightful people, as well as people who were less knowledgeable about certain things, but the overall exchange was really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve also been connecting with people from both Scrimba and 100Devs recently. With Scrimba, it&#8217;s been since January. With 100Devs, it&#8217;s only been about a week, but the chats that I&#8217;m having with these people have been pretty involved, so it takes some effort, but I find their stories interesting. Some of them live in or come from areas that are much more strife-ridden than where I&#8217;m from. A few have learned more about me and what happened in my life since coming to California. I&#8217;ve come to appreciate talking to them. It&#8217;s both therapeutic and mind-expanding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yesterday, I created a Discord server that I want to use to help people who are on the job hunt for a role in tech. I&#8217;ll probably start inviting people to it over the next few days. I plan on keeping it small, so we can stay very focused, but over time, I&#8217;ll grow it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-10

href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/08/javascript30-clock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>clock project</strong></a> from <strong><a href=\"https://javascript30.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JavaScript30</a> </strong>made use of several CSS properties and JavaScript methods that I’ve used infrequently in other projects. When I was building out the project and then adding onto it after, I ended up delving into their documentation to understand how they operate. This is some of what I learned:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Date()</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Date()</strong> constructor creates a new Date object representing a single moment in time. When called without any arguments, it returns the current date and time. Initially, we use it to get a new date value and save it to a const:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const now = new Date()</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>As of the time of this writing, that code returns: Fri Jan 13 2023 00:10:50 GMT-0800 (Pacific Standard Time). It’s Friday the 13th! From there, in order to position the clock hands, we created new variables to store the date’s seconds, minutes and hours. This information was extracted with methods attached to the Date() object:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const seconds = now.getSeconds()\nconst mins = now.getMinutes()\nconst hours = now.getHours()</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>I used the data returned from that to position the analog clock hands and to render the time using numbers in the digital clock that I added to the bottom of the project. In addition to that, I used several other methods to get the calendar date, which I appended below the digital clock:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const month = now.getMonth()\nconst date = now.getDate()\nconst year = now.getFullYear()</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"813\" height=\"455\" data-attachment-id=\"2402\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/13/javascripts-date-setinterval-and-style-property/js-new-date/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"813,455\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"js-new-date\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=813\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=813\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2402\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg 813w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js-new-date.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 813px) 100vw, 813px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to massage the values returned by these methods a little before rendering them onscreen by creating functions to format the time, day and month. For time, I wrote a function that appended a “0” to an hour, minute or second if it was less than 10, so that my digital clock used two digits for each field. I used that same function on the date in the calendar date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote another function that converted 24-hour time to 12-hour time for the digital clock. The <strong>.hours()</strong> method returns a value from 0 &#8211; 23. To correct this, just subtract 12 from any value greater than 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My last two formatting functions translated the day of the week and the month from numbers into names. For example “0” becomes “Sun”, “1” becomes “Mon” and so on for the days of the week and “0” becomes “Jan”, “1” becomes “Feb” and so on for the month.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date\" target=\"_blank\">MDN: Date</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/Date\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MDN: Date() constructor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_date.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">w3schools: JavaScript Date Reference</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_dates.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">w3schools: JavaScript Date Objects</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">setInterval()</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>setInterval()</strong> is a method that repeatedly calls a function or evaluates an expression at specified intervals (in milliseconds). This was the main execution code in the clock application. After setting up the functions that got the Date() and set its returned data into individual variables and formatted them, setInterval() called the function that makes everything go once every second. It looked like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>setInterval(setDate, 1000)</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>1,000 milliseconds is equal to 1 second, so it essentially caused the program to re-render every second with a new Date() and its extracted values. This was the little engine that could.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MDN: setInterval()</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">w3schools: Window setInterval() method</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">element.style.transform()</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have the <strong>.style.transform()</strong> method. This is essentially the JavaScript way of modifying the CSS transform property on an HTML element. <strong>.style</strong> essentially holds all of the properties available in CSS to style HTML elements. The one that we focused on during this project was:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>element.style.transform = `rotate(${someValue}deg)`</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, to change the seconds hand, I used:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>secondHand.style.transform = `rotate(${secondsDegrees}deg)`</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>setInterval() saw to it that the value was refreshed every second (as were all of the other date values, so the minutes and hours were refreshed as well, as were even longer-lasting parts of Date() like the day, month and year) and used to determine the angle to position each clock hand on the clock face. Only the seconds hand actually moved every second. The data for the other hands refreshed, but their position changed at their own intervals (every minute and every hour &#8211; surprise!).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main .transform property that we adjusted was the rotate() property, but other .transform properties and other .style properties, like .transition, were also used in the actual CSS for the project. I’ll discuss the CSS in another post, including the .transform from here, because although we’re using JavaScript to update the property data, it’s better grouped together as its own post (separation of concerns strikes again!).</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a href=\"https://javascript.info/styles-and-classes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">javascript.info: Styles and classes</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/style\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">MDN: HTMLElement.style</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_html_style.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">w3schools: HTML DOM Element style</a></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>The clock project from JavaScript30 made use of several CSS properties and JavaScript methods that I’ve used infrequently in other projects.

Clock","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/08/javascript30-clock/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-CB","content":"\n<p>The clock lesson in <strong><a href=\"https://javascript30.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">JavaScript30</a> </strong>guides you through building a digital representation of an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock that’s created displays the current time via hour, minute and second hands and updates in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is already set up with the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The HTML structure for the clock, including a container element to hold the clock and a couple of elements to display the hours, minutes, and seconds</li>\n\n\n\n<li>CSS to style the clock face and hands, along with a background image</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I wrote JavaScript code to animate the clock hands and synchronize them to move in real time. It sounds straightforward conceptually, but it was tricky to implement. I had to make use of the `<strong>Date</strong>` object to get the seconds, minutes and hours needed to animate the clock hands. The hands had to be styled using a <strong>transform/rotate</strong> to change from rendering horizontally (from 9:00 to 3:00 position) to vertically (12:00 to 6:00 position) and to rotate from their endpoint instead of centerpoint. Wes’ guidance was critical in understanding all of this and solutions to the issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Time was updated every second via the `<strong>setInterval</strong>` function in tandem with a function that used the `<strong>Date</strong>` object to get the hours, minutes and seconds needed to render the clock hands at the correct positions. CSS transitions were also used to control the animation of the clock hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the project, I customized it further by changing the size and color of the clock hands (hours is shortest, minutes is medium and seconds retain their original length). This called for the transform-origins to be changed so the clock hands rendered from their left sides and for removal of the transform rotations from css and placement in the JavaScript file to be calculated there using JavaScript and a new value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[edit 2023.01.08]</strong> I added the date at the bottom, below the digital clock. It shows the weekday, month, date and year, so today, for example, would render &#8220;Sun: Jan.08.2023&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that done, I changed the colors of clock hands and added a new background, to tie in the new look. I then added a digital clock at the bottom, which updates in real time with the analog clock above it and shows hours, minutes and seconds in the same colors as the matching clock hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"603\" data-attachment-id=\"2395\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/08/javascript30-clock/js30-clock/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1470,866\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"js30-clock\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2395\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-clock.jpg 1470w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main JavaScript features that were used in this project were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>functions</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Date()\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>getSeconds()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>getMinutes()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>getHours()</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>element.style.transform()\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>rotate()</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>setInterval()</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS styles that were used included:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>transform-origin</li>\n\n\n\n<li>transform: rotate()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>transition</li>\n\n\n\n<li>transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>transform: translateY()</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The formula used to convert the seconds into degrees so that the seconds hand could be properly animated was interesting. It’s (seconds / 60) * 360. Basically, the current number of seconds is divided by 60, which gives a value from 6 degrees ((1 / 60) * 360) to 360 degrees ((60 / 60) * 360). This tells us where to point the seconds hand. The minutes hand used the same formula, and the hours hand divided by 12 instead. Oh, the minimum value was actually 0 degrees (0 / 60), not 6 degrees. The value was further altered to change the starting axis, but the principle is the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a link to my deployed version: <a href=\"https://vish213-clock.netlify.app/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vish213-clock.netlify.app/</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The clock lesson in JavaScript30 guides you through building a digital representation of an analog clock using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

&#8216;kbd&#8217; and &#8216;audio&#8217; HTML elements","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/07/the-kbd-and-audio-html-elements/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Cn","content":"\n<p>When I worked on the drum kit project in JavaScript30, I came across two HTML elements that I&#8217;ve never used before, the <code>kbd</code> element and the <code>audio</code> element. Here&#8217;s a little information about them:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&lt;kbd&gt;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>kbd</code> element in HTML represents user input, typically entered through a keyboard. It&#8217;s generally used to indicate that the text it contains is entered by the user or used to illustrate key combinations to execute a command. It is often displayed in a monospace font to make it stand out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how the <code>kbd</code> element could be used:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>To save the file, press &lt;kbd&gt;Ctrl&lt;/kbd&gt; + &lt;kbd&gt;S&lt;/kbd&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, the <code>kbd</code> element is used to indicate that the user should press the &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; keys on their keyboard to save the file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>kbd</code> element is a inline element, which means it can be used within a block of text and does not take up the full width of the page. It&#8217;s often used in conjunction with other elements, such as the <code>code</code> element, to indicate that the text it contains is code or other types of user input.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"934\" height=\"536\" data-attachment-id=\"2383\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/07/the-kbd-and-audio-html-elements/html-kbd-element/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"934,536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"html-kbd-element\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=934\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=934\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2383\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg 934w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-kbd-element.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Note in the above image how the &#8220;Ctrl&#8221; and &#8220;S&#8221; are displayed in monotype, and the rest of the text is in the default font.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_kbd.asp\" target=\"_blank\">w3schools: HTML kbd tag</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd\" target=\"_blank\">MDN: &lt;kbd&gt;: The Keyboard input element</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">&lt;audio&gt;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>audio</code> element in HTML is used to embed audio files into an HTML document. It allows you to add audio to your web page and control how it&#8217;s played, such as whether it should start playing automatically or whether it should have controls for the user to start and stop the audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s an example of how the <code>audio</code> element can be used:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>&lt;audio src=\"song.mp3\" controls&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>This will embed an audio file with the URL &#8220;song.mp3&#8221; into the HTML document and display controls for the user to play and pause the audio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>audio</code> element supports various attributes that can be used to customize its behavior. For example, the <code>autoplay</code> attribute can be used to make the audio start playing automatically when the page loads, and the <code>loop</code> attribute can be used to make the audio play repeatedly.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"934\" height=\"536\" data-attachment-id=\"2388\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/07/the-kbd-and-audio-html-elements/html-audio-element/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"934,536\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"html-audio-element\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=934\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=934\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2388\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg 934w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/html-audio-element.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 934px) 100vw, 934px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Note in the image above that I haven&#8217;t linked to an actual audio file, so the displayed duration is 0:00 instead of showing an actual track length.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the JavaScript30 drum kit project, we manipulated the audio element using JavaScript after grabbing the correct element using a <strong>querySelector</strong>. One of the things we did was force playback to start from the beginning of a WAV file if that file was called again, using <code>audio.currentTime = 0</code>.

Drum kit","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/07/javascript30-drum-kit/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Ce","content":"\n<p>I’m working on improving my vanilla JavaScript skills. After finishing <strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/05/scrimba-learn-javascript-for-free/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Scrimba’s Learn JavaScript for free</a></strong> course two days ago, I decided to start tackling <strong><a href=\"https://javascript30.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Wes Bos’ JavaScript30</a></strong>. It’s been on my list for at least 3 years, and I started yesterday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first project, building a JavaScript drum kit, was really fun. My kids played with it for a while after I built it out, so I lost an hour or so of coding time after it was done, but I gained an hour of downtime for my brain, so it’s a net win.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of the lesson is to create an application that plays a different sound for each drum pad when a corresponding keyboard key is pressed. The application should also include a visual indicator that shows which drum pad or key is being played. The HTML page comes with a “drum kit” rendered onscreen. There are squares that correspond to the middle row of letters on a keyboard running along the middle of the window. So, the letters A, S, D, F, G, H, J, K and L are represented. Each has the name of a drum sound below it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our task is to use JavaScript to connect it to a set of WAV files so that they play when the given key is pressed. This includes adding event listeners to the buttons and the keys on the keyboard, and using the `<strong>audio</strong>` element to play the corresponding drum sound when a button or key is pressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is already set up with the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The HTML structure for the drum pads and the display</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The CSS styles to render the HTML elements appropriately</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I had to write JavaScript code to handle the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Play the sound for each drum pad when the corresponding key is pressed</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Update the display to show which drum pad or key is being played</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add/remove a &#8220;playing&#8221; class to the drum pads to create a visual effect when they are played</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Set up the WAV playback so that it restarts if the same key is pressed multiple times, instead of letting the first trigger of the WAV play all the way through, so a drum pad can be hit repeatedly</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"500\" data-attachment-id=\"2372\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/07/javascript30-drum-kit/js30-drumkit/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1920,939\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"js30-drumkit\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2372\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/js30-drumkit.jpg 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The main JavaScript features that were used in this project were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>document.querySelector()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>document.querySelectorAll()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.forEach()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.addEventListener()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.classList.add</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.classList.remove</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.propertyName</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.play()</li>\n\n\n\n<li>.currentTime</li>\n\n\n\n<li>event.keyCode <em>(this is deprecated!)</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>HTML features &amp; elements that were introduced that I haven’t used much before included:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>data- attributes</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&lt;kbd&gt; element</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&lt;audio&gt; element</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a fun project to start the series off with, and it’s different from every other JavaScript project I’ve done because it connects event listeners to sounds instead of manipulating onscreen elements. I love that change of pace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I changed the background, but didn’t do much else to make the project different from its typical implementation. After seeing how much the kids liked it, I’m going to take time to record them making some of the weird noises they like to make at their age and then build out a similar project that lets them trigger their own sound effects via keyboard. There are a bunch of things I want to try, to see if I can achieve similar results with a different approach. I’ll post about that after I’ve built it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a link to my deployed version: <a href=\"https://vish213-drumkit.netlify.app/\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://vish213-drumkit.netlify.app/</a></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>I’m working on improving my vanilla JavaScript skills.

Learn JavaScript for free","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/05/scrimba-learn-javascript-for-free/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-BK","content":"\n<p>Happy New Year! It’s been 7 months since I last wrote on this blog. I think that in an older post, I said that I was going through some significant life changes. Well, some of that is settled now, and maybe I’ll discuss it in the future, but for now I’m going to write about a free course I just completed: <strong><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript\">Learn JavaScript for free</a></strong>, from <strong><a href=\"https://scrimba.com/\">Scrimba</a></strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started the course a month ago but didn’t get to work on it every day. The video runtimes total about 8 hours in length, and if you’ve already learned some JavaScript and want a refresher, it’s a fun one. Basics, like variables, math operators, functions and data types like objects and arrays are covered, but they’re all combined with essential DOM manipulation techniques, like getElementById(), createElement(), modifying HTML elements through innerText, textContent and innerHTML and the like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several short projects are built throughout the course, which make use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the focus being the latter. Three projects are the focus of guided tutorials and make use of concepts covered in videos. Three others are solo projects which are presented via Figma designs and brief specifications. These include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>A passenger counter app (guided tutorial)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A basketball scoreboard (solo project)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A blackjack game (guided tutorial)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A password generator (solo project)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A Chrome extension (guided tutorial)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A metric/standard unit converter (solo project)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-11 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure

three 20-30 minute practice sections with 9 or 10 lessons in each that can be completed after each of the guided tutorial sections. They allow students to practice concepts that were learned in the aforementioned tutorial sections for some extra reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s been a while since I practiced vanilla JavaScript, and I’ve never felt that my JavaScript skills are especially strong. The majority of the projects I’ve built in the past 18 months used React or Next.js and were largely websites, not applications. This Scrimba course is one step I’ve taken towards strengthening my core JavaScript skills. I’m happy with the results. It’s an incremental set of lessons that drills fundamentals and basic DOM manipulation, which I think are foundational skills for web development.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery

There are accountability channels in it (#today-i-will and #today-i-did), achievement channels (#i-got-hired and #i-built-this) and help channels dedicated to JavaScript, design, HTML &amp; CSS, React and “other”, among other channels. At any given time, there are hundreds of students logged in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like the platform. I like that the lessons take place in an interactive editor. I also like that concepts are presented in bite-sized chunks and are project-based. I was able to practice more by building my own small projects along the way, based on concepts that we reviewed in each section. One of these was a small project that uses random numbers to display characters in a Street Fighter II splash screen matchup, mainly to entertain my kids. It was based on a random emoji fighter project from the course. Another was an AD&amp;D 2nd Edition character stat roller that also used random numbers for stat generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m likely going to go through the other free courses on Scrimba and then consider paying for their<strong> <a href=\"https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend\">Frontend Developer Career Path</a></strong> course, which is 75 hours long and includes the lessons from <strong>Learn JavaScript for free</strong> in its <strong>Module 3: Making websites interactive</strong> lesson.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped wp-block-gallery-13 is-layout-flex wp-block-gallery-is-layout-flex\">\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://adnd-stat-roller.netlify.app/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"553\" height=\"611\" data-attachment-id=\"2352\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/05/scrimba-learn-javascript-for-free/proj-dnd-stat-roller/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"553,611\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"proj-dnd-stat-roller\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg?w=272\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg?w=553\" data-id=\"2352\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg?w=553\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2352\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg 553w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg?w=136 136w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-dnd-stat-roller.jpg?w=272 272w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://vish213-sf.netlify.app/\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"656\" data-attachment-id=\"2353\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2023/01/05/scrimba-learn-javascript-for-free/proj-singh-fighter/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1328,852\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"proj-singh-fighter\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=1024\" data-id=\"2353\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2353\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/proj-singh-fighter.jpg 1328w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a></figure>\n</figure>\n","excerpt":"<p>Happy New Year!

In that time, I’ve made a lot of headway with adding a shop to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.breastcancercomfort.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Breast Cancer Comfort</a></strong> website. I expect to have it completed by the end of the month. Almost all of the functionality is done, with tweaks being made daily. I’m waiting on the team for gift descriptions and to Zoom and pick gift images from the assortment that were sent to me. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is my first ecommerce site, and I’m happy that it&#8217;s something that I hand-coded instead of using a builder like WordPress. I’ve wanted that experience for some time now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, I shared a little about it on <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vish213_breastcancercomfort-webdevelopment-cancer-activity-6921509051822485504-NwAn?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn</a></strong> and got a good response. Between the replies to the post and direct messages, there was a lot of interest in how I built the shop. I informed people there that I would write about the process on the blog and share it, to help other junior developers. I’m starting that now. This post won’t be technical, I’m just going to recap how I found BCC to begin with and what it&#8217;s been like working with them. I’ll get into details about the tech and the process in upcoming posts, as I need to organize my thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Background</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 2019, I applied for and was accepted into the web development track at <strong><a href=\"https://www.bloomtech.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Lambda School</a></strong>, an online coding bootcamp. I completed the online precourse, which went through fundamentals of <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS </strong>and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I then took an online entrance exam and managed to pass it on my third attempt (so don’t give up if you’re just starting out &#8211; try and try again). Lambda’s Web23 cohort started in August with me in tow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web23 was a full-time cohort which meant that students were expected to complete the curriculum through weekly sprints over the course of 9 months. After about 2 months, I found that I had woefully underestimated how difficult switching careers and learning these new skills could be. The faint memories of BASIC and Pascal that I had enjoyed in the early 90s couldn’t help to maintain the pace needed to keep up with the rest of the cohort and I ended up switching to part-time and flexing (repeating) some units to really drill certain concepts. The speed and sheer volume of information was overwhelming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve said before that I have nothing but respect for students who are able to go through the full-time curriculum. It&#8217;s like machine gun fire, with new concepts and projects being shot at you every day and a sprint challenge to demonstrate understanding of all of it at the end of every week. Additionally, my family and I moved from NY to CA in the middle of things (I think I was in the Node/backend portion of the curriculum at that point) and I took several weeks off to complete the move and find somewhere to live. Being a father to two young kids while moving cross-country and being up coding until the small hours of the night, virtually every night, made the experience truly grueling. Ultimately, I graduated in about 18 months, which was standard for part-time students. It was rough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During either Thanksgiving or winter break in 2019, I discovered <strong>The Breast Cancer Comfort Foundation</strong> on a website called <strong><a href=\"https://www.volunteermatch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VolunteerMatch</a></strong>. The site allows non-profit organizations to post volunteer positions for which they need assistance. I was looking to support a cause whose mission aligned with my values, and theirs certainly did. I’ve lost several people who I cared for to various forms of cancer. I also know survivors and marvel at how they embrace life after fighting through the horrors of both the disease and its treatments. I wanted to apply the skills I had been building at bootcamp in a real-world setting and start adding projects to my portfolio. BCC had posted looking for help with their website, and after reviewing it, I decided that I would attempt to help them.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><a href=\"https://breast-cancer-comfort.netlify.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Breast Cancer Comfort website v1</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.volunteermatch.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VolunteerMatch</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Version 1 (HTML &amp; CSS)</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"725\" data-attachment-id=\"2318\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2022/05/11/building-an-ecommerce-site-for-the-breast-cancer-comfort-foundation-history/bcc-v1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1377,976\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-v1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2318\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=1024\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-v1.jpg 1377w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><em><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\" class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">The demo version of the Breast </mark></em><br><em><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\" class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">Cancer Comfort website (v1)</mark></em></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The original BCC website had been built over what appeared to be 5 years with <strong>WordPress</strong>. It lacked structure and content. Most of the pages were placeholders.There were pages that were better suited as blog posts, and there were blog posts that should have been pages or sections in other pages (like photo galleries, donor lists and volunteer pages).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spent a day combing through the site and Googling the organization. During that time, I copied all of the website’s contents into a set of Google docs and organized it. I found articles and videos online that provided more background information about the organization and their founder, <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/debi-cavolo-671a78132\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Debi Cavolo</a></strong>. She was a nurse and a cancer survivor. Coming from the background of working in IT with nursing homes and then at an EMR for about two decades, I’ve found that I love working with clinicians. My closest mentor was a nurse who I lost to melanoma. She started several companies, including the EMR that I worked for and she fit exceptionally well into a team of techies. It was almost a sign. That weekend, I began to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using the documents I had created, I put together a simple website. I had already organized the information, grouping text together into related categories and cutting parts that were insufficiently fleshed out. I focused on arranging text content first, creating pages and a structure to house all of the information I had gathered and organized. I made a template so that I could build pages rapidly and did my best to ensure that the information on each page was grouped logically. I tried to edit the text to be readable while not erasing the voice it was written in, and to be as grammatically-correct as I could make it without being stiff and overly formal. I enjoy writing and editing, but (as evidenced by this post) I can run on at times.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My budding HTML and CSS skills were put to the test, and by the end of the day I had drafted a simple 5-page website consisting of Home, Boobtique, Donate, Volunteer and Team pages. I looked to other websites with a focus on combating cancer as a source of design inspiration, but did my best to not duplicate them, as the organization needed to be distinct from others in their class. I added color to the site (mainly black and pink) to make it contrast with the existing WordPress implementation and, like many of us, cringed inwardly at my less-than-stellar design skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, I went through each page and made it responsive. I also did my best to apply the smidge of JavaScript that I understood to make a menu for the site. I’ve met a lot of developers who love JavaScript and hate CSS. My skills are more of the opposite. I remember how intimidating it was to puzzle through switching from a navbar to a hamburger menu for mobile devices. In the end, I felt like I had accomplished something. Nowadays, I can build out a responsive navbar using CSS alone (CSS Grid and media breakpoints can accomplish a lot) in addition to falling back to JavaScript to add or subtract classes and styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With hope guiding my fingers, I went to the organization’s <strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/breastcancercomfort/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Facebook page</a></strong> and sent a message to Debi letting her know that I had discovered them through VolunteerMatch, was transitioning from IT to a web development role and had built a proof-of-concept website for them based on their existing WordPress one. I shared the link and said that if they like it, they could keep it, but If they didn’t, it was still a fun exercise for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, they liked it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met with Debi and <strong>Susan Weber</strong> at their office the next weekend and became their web developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>2019.12.04 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/04/i-got-my-first-client-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I got my first client project!</a></li><li>2019.12.17 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/17/roadbumps-with-my-first-client-project/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Roadbumps with my first client project</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Version 2 (WordPress &amp; Divi)</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"882\" data-attachment-id=\"2185\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/netlify-godaddy-08/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1096,945\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"netlify-godaddy-08\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2185\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=1024\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/netlify-godaddy-08.jpg 1096w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\" class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">The 2nd version of the Breast Cancer <br>Comfort website (WordPress &amp; Divi)</mark></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>During the first few months of my working with BCC, the organization expanded and took on new volunteers. One of these was a marketing person. He asked me if I could rebuild the site I had implemented using WordPress and <strong>Divi</strong>, an editor for WP. His rationalization was that if I wasn’t available, no one else knew how to code, and that other people should be able to make website updates without waiting for me. Although I didn’t anticipate a time in which I’d be unduly unavailable, I understood his reasoning and endeavored to learn how to use Divi and rebuild the website. It was hell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Divi is probably a fine tool for people who don’t code. Using it wasn’t a pleasant experience for me. Everything that I could do in minutes with CSS took hours with Divi. Work multiplied as I had to make two versions of every page or block using their editor so that the site could support both mobile screens and larger ones. Gone was the swiftness of adjusting layouts with media query breakpoints and <strong>Flexbox</strong>. I no longer had the option to use <strong>CSS Grid</strong> to create layouts and write quick CSS classes to format images. And the WordPress/Divi combo was laggy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building with Divi was slow, and I didn’t like being trapped in the WordPress ecosystem. We had to find plug-ins for everything functional that we wanted to add to the site, like adding a carousel to the homepage. I also didn’t want it to cost the organization any money, if at all possible. The icing on the cake is that in 2020, the marketing director who had joined us had his first baby and left. I inherited Divi as technical debt and spent the rest of the year updating the website with one arm tied behind my back. Content was added to the website in dribs and drabs, but nothing substantial.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bootcamp also got intense (hello, data structures &amp; algorithms, Big-O-Notation and the surprise of having to learn Python to solve coding challenges when we had been a JavaScript institution all along) at the same time that we moved cross-country from NY to CA, and some other heavy life events struck that I’m still recovering from. I didn’t do much with the website on a technical level. Updates were mainly text and images. Sometimes, there would be a blog post to publish. At the tail end of 2020, over winter break from the bootcamp, I learned <strong><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Next.js</a></strong> (the tutorial on their website is fantastic) and built out a website with it that I would redesign and rebuild early in 2021. I used the experience gained from those two projects to guide me with another task I’d been itching to undertake: running as fast away from Divi as humanly possible and rebuilding the site with Next.js.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Version 3 (Next.js)</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-cover is-light\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-cover__background has-background-dim\"></span><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"614\" data-attachment-id=\"2317\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2022/05/11/building-an-ecommerce-site-for-the-breast-cancer-comfort-foundation-history/bcc-shop-page-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1440,864\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-shop-page-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"wp-block-cover__image-background wp-image-2317\" alt=\"\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=1024\" data-object-fit=\"cover\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/bcc-shop-page-2.jpg 1440w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /><div class=\"wp-block-cover__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-cover-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center has-large-font-size\"><mark style=\"background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);\" class=\"has-inline-color has-white-color\">The current version of the Breast Cancer Comfort website (Next.js)</mark></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><br>The next version of the BCC website (see what I did there) is the one that’s still currently in production. I had always planned to rebuild the site using <strong>React</strong>, but as a React framework, Next is everything React is plus more. Built-in routing, server-side rendering, the Link component, the Image component, component-scoped CSS-in-JS styling, global styles and so much more make it a joy to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With control of the website back in my hands, and the ability to actually write code and marvel that my fledgling JavaScript works, I was able to add functional components to the website that I had really wanted to but couldn’t do with Divi. I added a contact form to the bottom of every page and made it work with Netlify functions to avoid having to build and host a backend. A Google Maps component was embedded with the organization’s location pinned in the middle. I integrated BCC’s Facebook page feed into the news/blog section &#8211; all of the blog posts display the feed. I built out an index page of all the blog articles using JavaScript and JSX (it maps through an array of summarized blog data and renders the list) and threw the FB feed on there too for good measure, updated the Supporters page with tiers that were distinguished using <strong>Font Awesome</strong> icons and did some other fun things. It&#8217;s liberating to have the freedom to see a need, imagine a solution and then puzzle out a method to implement it instead of hoping that someone wrote a WP plug-in that can do what I want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the here-and-now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big task that I’ve focused on for the past month or so has been learning about <strong>ecommerce </strong>and building a shop. It&#8217;s something I’ve wanted to tackle, but have been intimidated by, for at least a year. I know you other juniors know what I’m talking about. The next few blog posts will dive into the details about how I went about it, but a high-level summary is that I researched a ton of options and eventually went with building my own cart and using <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://stripe.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stripe</a> </strong>for payment processing and <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.easypost.com/\" target=\"_blank\">easypost</a> </strong>for shipping. Instead of building a <strong>Node/Express</strong> backend, I went for broke and tried implementing with <strong><a href=\"https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Netlify serverless functions</a></strong>. So far… it works! Because we don’t rely on a separate, permanent backend, the organization doesn’t have to pay for a server instance that’s constantly live, so we save money. At our size, it meets our needs perfectly. And before the month is through, it should go live, along with the rest of this writeup detailing the process of constructing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>2021.04.22 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2021/04/22/april-2021-update/\">April 2021 Update</a></li><li>2021.07.06 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2021/07/06/connect-a-godaddy-domain-to-a-netlify-website/\">Connect a GoDaddy domain to a Netlify website</a></li><li>2022.03.07 <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2022/03/07/use-font-awesome-with-next-js/\">Use Font Awesome with Next.js</a></li></ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>It&#8217;s been about 2 months since I last wrote here.

haven&#8217;t made time to write since November. Life circumstances got in the way, but I might get into that in a later post. Last week, I added support tiers to the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.breastcancercomfort.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Breast Cancer Comfort website</strong></a>. I&#8217;ll expand on the format in a future iteration. For now, supporters are distinguished by icons next to their names, with a different one for <em>platinum</em>, <em>gold</em>, <em>silver</em>, <em>bronze</em> and <em>friend</em> levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When adding icons to a site, like many, I turn to <strong><a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://fontawesome.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Font Awesome</a></strong> as my first port-of-call. The BCC website was last built using <strong><a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Next.js</a></strong>, so here&#8217;s the procedure I used to make Font Awesome and Next.js work together:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Install the Font Awesome packages into your Next.js project. They&#8217;ll come from <strong>Fort Awesome</strong> &#8211; its not a typo.

Authentication Using Session Auth","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/11/03/zapier-authentication-using-session-auth/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Am","content":"\n<p>Building an integration with <strong>Zapier</strong> starts with authentication. This gives Zapier the ability to use the given user’s credentials to log into an application and access the parts of its API that have been connected to Zapier. For me, this was the hardest part of building an integration between Zapier and our company’s application, <strong>AIMM</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, I was only able to get authentication working with a single, hard-coded user. This worked for testing purposes and to let me create <strong>Zaps</strong> between AIMM and other programs, but it wouldn’t suffice for a production environment in which multiple users from different companies had to log in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zapier supports 5 types of authentication: <em>basic auth</em>, <em>session auth</em>, <em>API key auth</em>, <em>OAuth v2</em> and <em>digest auth</em>. AIMM’s backend already worked using <strong>session auth</strong> and <strong>JavaScript Web Tokens</strong> (JWTs) so when I initially met with the more seasoned developers who are building the application, we decided to make use of that with Zapier as well. This guide will walk through how I set up session auth.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Prerequisites</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you begin configuring Zapier to authenticate to your backend, you need to have some pieces of data:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>You need to have the URL to the endpoint that’s used by your application’s backend for authentication and JWT issuance</li><li>You need to know how to make a web request for that token (ideally, test this using <strong><a href=\"https://www.postman.com/\">Postman</a></strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://insomnia.rest/\">Insomnia</a></strong>)</li><li>You need to have login credentials to use for authentication</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>In my case, AIMM’s backend was documented using a tool that was new to me called <strong><a href=\"https://swagger.io/\">Swagger</a></strong>. Swagger essentially uses JavaScript on the backend to describe an API’s endpoints which allows it to render a page that displays those endpoints and make test requests to it. Our TL gave me the URL for the endpoint that’s used for authentication and token issuance and told me how to structure the request. I tested it both in Swagger and with Insomnia, to make sure that I could get it to work, because I had to duplicate that process in Zapier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is what it looked like in Insomnia. I’ve removed the endpoint address from the POST request and the credentials from the header. The token itself (access_token) is expired, so that piece of data hasn’t been obscured.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div

token <em>from </em>your application’s backend, you also need to know how to include it in any needed requests <em>to </em>the backend. For example, one of the endpoints in our backend returns an array of all customers. This is used to display a customer list for a given company in our application. When I call that endpoint, I need to include a JWT to confirm that I am, indeed, authorized to exchange data with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different endpoints might have additional requirements when making a request. Some might need additional information in the request header, or might need a JSON object in the request body, so make sure that you know how to properly structure a request to any endpoints you need to connect Zapier with. Test these requests using Postman or Insomnia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Below is an example of a request in Insomnia to retrieve all customers’ data from AIMM’s API (yes, its a POST request, not a GET request). Note that the request sends JSON in the request body as well as a token in the header.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-tiled-gallery aligncenter is-style-rectangular\"><div

(the data needed to get a JWT and the data needed to test that token with an API call) we can begin configuring Zapier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Authentication</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A working authentication is the first step in setting up a Zapier integration. The token that’s returned by the API will be used to authorize any API calls made by Zaps once the integration is built. So, what we’re doing here is telling Zapier how to talk to our app&#8217;s backend for all future transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The process for setting up authentication is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Configure authentication fields (essentially, create a form that collects the user’s login information so that Zapier can use it)</li><li>Configure a token exchange request (use data from the above authentication fields to connect to an endpoint at the API and retrieve a JWT)</li><li>Configure a test request (use the token gained above and successfully call an endpoint to verify that API calls work)</li><li>(optional) Set up a connection label (each connection authenticates to the API to get a token; these connections represent different users &#8211; I labeled each connection with the name of the company followed by the username so I can tell at a glance who the user is and which company they belong to)</li><li>Test the authentication</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s walk through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a new integration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>First, if you don’t have a Zapier account, create one. Once you do have one, log in. Next, scroll to the bottom of the website and click on “<strong>Developer Platform</strong>”. Once that page loads, click on “<strong>My Integrations</strong>” at the top of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From here, click on the blue “<strong>Start a Zapier Integration</strong>” button at the top of the screen and complete the form to set up your integration. All of the fields should be relatively easy to fill out. Their names and purposes are self-explanatory (Name, Description, Homepage URL, Logo, Intended Audience, Role, Category) and have brief descriptions under their labels. The last 3 use drop-downs from which answers can be selected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click “<strong>Create</strong>” when you’re done and you move on to the integration’s configuration section. On the left is a sidebar which displays the selected menu item in the right pane. We want to focus on the “<strong>Build</strong>” section. We’ll start with “<strong>Authentication</strong>” and in later posts, we’ll examine “<strong>Triggers</strong>” and “<strong>Actions</strong>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configure authentication fields</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on the blue “<strong>Set Up Authentication</strong>” button in the right pane. We’re given a list of authentication options that Zapier supports. For our purposes, we’re going to go with <strong>Session Auth</strong>. Click the blue “<strong>Save</strong>” button at the bottom of the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"716\" data-attachment-id=\"2261\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zapier-auth-5/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1327,928\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zapier-auth-5\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2261\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-5.jpg 1327w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We’re now taken to the Session Auth configuration screen. Lets walk through how I set up session authentication for AIMM:</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configure your fields</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the “Step 1” section, we add fields that will be used to create a form which users will fill out with their login information for the application being integrated with Zapier. For AIMM, this required three fields: <em>company name</em>, <em>username</em> and <em>password</em>. There is a 4th field with a value that never changes that we’ll look at in the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click on “<strong>Add Fields</strong>” and complete the form to add a new field. There are two field types: <strong>field</strong> and <strong>computed field</strong>. We want to use the first one: field. This created user-fillable fields. The second type (computed field) uses data that we pass in, programmatically. I didn&#8217;t use it in AIMM&#8217;s setup for this step.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li><strong>Label</strong> is what the user will see in the form. It shows them the field&#8217;s name.</li><li><strong>Key</strong> is what we’ll see when we manipulate the field using JavaScript. Try to match this with the name used by the application&#8217;s API.</li><li>Check the box to mark each field as “required” if it is (all of the ones I used are). </li><li><strong>Type</strong> is generally going to be <em>string</em>, for which you can just leave the field blank. </li><li>Change Type to “Password” if you want typed characters to appear as asterisks onscreen. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For testing purposes, you can give each field a <strong>default value</strong>. This will appear in the field’s input box when the login screen is shown to the user, but can be overwritten by typing over it. Click the “<strong>Add</strong>” button at the bottom of the screen when you’re finished filling in information to setup the current field and then repeat the process for any others that are needed. Once all of the fields that the user needs to fill out are defined, click the blue “<strong>Continue</strong>” button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was done, my authentication fields looked like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"716\" data-attachment-id=\"2262\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zapier-auth-6/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1327,928\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zapier-auth-6\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2262\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-6.jpg 1327w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configure a token exchange request</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>With the login fields defined, we move onto the token exchange request, or Step 2. This is the step for which we gathered information in the prerequisites step, above. For this step, switch to <strong>code mode</strong>. Refer to the testing that you completed with Postman or Insomnia and modify the provided code in the editor with the settings and parameters that your API needs to get a JWT. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’ll need your token exchange endpoint, any necessary headers, params and/or JSON for the body. You’ll also need to know what your API calls the token that it produces. Find this in the response body from Insomnia or Postman.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is what the token exchange code to connect to AIMM looks like:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const options = {\n  url: '&#091;removed for privacy, use the URL from Postman/Insomnia]',\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',\n    'Accept': 'application/json'\n  },\n  params: {\n\n  },\n  body: {\n    'company': bundle.authData.company,\n    'username': bundle.authData.username,\n    'password': bundle.authData.password,\n    'grant_type': 'password',\n  }\n}\n\nreturn z.request(options)\n  .then((response) =&gt; {\n    response.throwForStatus();\n    const results = response.json;\n    console.log(results.access_token);\n\n    return {\n      'accessToken': results.access_token,\n    };\n  });\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the AIMM request has no params, but does have headers and a request body. To get the values that the user typed into the form we configured in Step 1, we preface each field name with “<strong>bundle.authData.</strong>” As mentioned in Step 1, a 4th field is added to the request body here: <em>grant_type</em>. The value of this field is always “password” so we supply it here and the user doesn’t need to know about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name of the JWT returned from AIMM’s API is “access_token”. Your application probably uses a different name, which can be found by examining the response body for your token request in Postman or Insomnia. Return that value in the code for the token exchange request, so that Zapier holds onto it for the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As an aside, Zapier has its own global object, much like “window” or “console” in JavaScript or Node. Its simply called “<strong>z</strong>”. If you need to run any tests, like console.log, use “z.console.log” to make them work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click “<strong>Save &amp; Continue</strong>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Configure a test request &amp; connection label</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we come to Step 3, in which Zapier will be configured to use data from the user-inputted fields and the token from the previous two steps to call an API endpoint and perform an action. For my test, I called an endpoint in AIMM that returns all of the customers for a given company (the company that the user specified during login). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can call any endpoint that you’d like from your application’s API as long as you know all of the parameters that it needs to make the call. In my case, no special parameters were needed; no params and no request body. All I needed were the endpoint’s URL and the right headers, which included the JWT gotten from Step 2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like before, switch to code mode and modify the pregenerated code to connect to your chosen endpoint. The test endpoint connection used to test AIMM looked like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>const options = {\n   url: '&#091;removed for privacy, use the URL from Postman/Insomnia]',\n  method: 'POST',\n  headers: {\n    'content-type': 'application/json',\n    'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + bundle.authData.accessToken,\n  },\n  params: {\n\n  },\n  body: {\n\n  }\n}\n\nreturn z.request(options)\n  .then((response) =&gt; {\n    response.throwForStatus();\n    const results = response.json;\n\n    // You can do any parsing you need for results here before returning them\n\n    return results;\n  });\n</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>Note that the <strong>Authorization</strong> key in the headers object includes a value which passes in the JWT obtained in Step 2. The format that your application’s API uses to pass in the token might differ from what AIMM’s API uses, so consult the test from Postman or Insomnia to make sure that its correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<h5 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Connection label</h5>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an optional step in which the connection label can be named. I switched to code mode here as well and configured the label to include the company name followed by the username of the person whose credentials were being used to make the connection to AIMM. It looks like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"700\" height=\"453\" data-attachment-id=\"2263\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zapier-auth-7/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"700,453\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zapier-auth-7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg?w=700\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg?w=700\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2263\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg 700w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-7.jpg?w=300 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The field names used by your application will differ, of course, but its probably not a bad idea to configure the label to at least use the username of the person who is authenticating. This is especially useful if several people share the same computer and use it to access the integrated application.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Click “<strong>Save &amp; Continue</strong>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Test your authentication</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we come to the last step: testing the authentication. Here, we’ll use the information that the user provided in the form we created to authenticate to the server and get a JavaScript web token, and then we’ll send that token along in an HTTP request to an endpoint at the API. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If everything works, we’ll get a successful response and avoid the weeks of self-doubt and dismay that I experienced the first time I tried to make this work. If it doesn’t work, fall back on your troubleshooting skills and examine the error message for clues as to why the world is spinning so uncontrollably off-course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, click the blue “<strong>Sign in</strong>” button in the middle of the section. If you’re re-testing, you can click the drop-down here to add a new account or choose from an existing one. A sign-in screen will appear containing the fields that were defined in Step 1. Fill out the form and submit it. Zapier will take that information and use it to try and get a token from the application’s API. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"850\" height=\"491\" data-attachment-id=\"2265\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zapier-auth-8/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"850,491\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zapier-auth-8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=850\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=850\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2265\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg 850w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zapier-auth-8.jpg?w=768 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 850px) 100vw, 850px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If it succeeds, click on “<strong>Test Authentication</strong>” to use that token to make an API call to the endpoint specified in Step 3.

to Zapier","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2021/11/02/introduction-to-zapier/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-Ad","content":"\n<p>As related in previous posts, I started my first developer job about 2 ½ months ago. One of the tasks I was assigned at work was to use an online business automation website called <strong>Zapier</strong> to connect our application (<strong>AIMM</strong>) with some other programs, namely <strong>QuickBooks Online</strong> (QBO) and a whitelabeled CRM called <strong>Salespype</strong> (CRM).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The initial step was to connect applications so that customer data was able to move from AIMM to the CRM, and then from AIMM to QBO. After that, the next step was to connect the applications in the other direction, so that customers who are first entered in QBO or the CRM could be automatically duplicated in AIMM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This task took me much longer than it should have. I made progress and got things working in both directions, but <strong>authentication</strong> wasn’t working the way I needed it to, until today. Previously, I was authenticating using hard-coded data with the same account information instead of dynamic data which would allow different users to log into their AIMM accounts. This allowed me to get everything working, but of course couldn’t work in production because all users would be the same user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is the introduction to a series that shows how I built AIMM’s Zapier integration. Hopefully, it will help other beginner developers who have a similar task. These are the basic steps we’ll look at:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Building a Zapier integration:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Authentication</li><li>Triggers</li><li>Actions</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Setting up Zaps:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Sending customer data from AIMM to the CRM</li><li>Sending customer data from AIMM to QBO</li><li>Sending customer data from the CRM to AIMM</li><li>Sending customer data from QBO to AIMM</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"389\" data-attachment-id=\"2248\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zap-creation-41/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1434,546\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zap-creation-41\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2248\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/zap-creation-41.jpg 1434w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Integrations</strong> are the term used to describe an application’s connection to Zapier. Integrations are composed of three main parts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\"><li>Authentication: signing into the given application from Zapier</li><li>Triggers: conditions that Zapier looks for to let it know to do something</li><li>Actions: responses to an activated trigger</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Triggers</strong> and <strong>actions</strong> are like cause and effect, or like if/then statements. If a trigger happens, then an action (or a series of actions) activates. For example, if a new customer is added in AIMM, then that same customer should be created in QBO and in the CRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication, triggers and actions must be set up before users can create <strong>Zaps</strong>, which are the main focus of Zapier. Zaps are the processes that make use of triggers and actions to let users automate parts of their workflows.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different applications have different sets of triggers and actions. Some are more robust than others. For example, right now, AIMM has only one real trigger and set of actions revolving around customer data. Later on, I’m going to add more triggers and actions to accommodate other tasks &#8211; for example employee time tracking and updating customers instead of only adding new ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My current understanding is that Zaps will mainly make use of typical <strong>CRUD</strong> operations (create, read, update, delete). At a higher level, there could be other uses I’m not familiar with yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ok. So the next post will move on to <em>authentication</em>.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>As related in previous posts, I started my first developer job about 2 ½ months ago.

programming job. I’m not really happy with it. The company is essentially a startup. They’ve been around for years as a set of construction and contractor companies, but the software side of the business is relatively new.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The product I’m working on is called <strong>AIMM</strong>. Its based on the book <strong>Am I Making Any Money</strong> from <strong>Pacific OutDoor Living</strong> and was written by their founder, <strong>Terry Morrill</strong>. The book contains a system whereby contractors and other types of businesses can determine on an ongoing basis if their business is profitable. It was originally developed as an <strong>MS Access</strong> application and used internally by POL throughout their operations before they determined that they could market it and make it available to other companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once they started actively developing the program, they moved from Access to <strong>Visual Basic</strong>. This was a client/server application, and although the system was running, they found that it was difficult to share and grow it, so they hired a team and began porting it to <strong>C#</strong> and making it a web application. I don’t know the circumstances, but that version was never completed and work began on an updated version using <strong>React</strong> for the frontend and maintaining the C# backend. That’s the version I’m working <em>with</em>, but not directly <em>on</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"465\" data-attachment-id=\"2225\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/zapier/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1363,620\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"zapier\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2225\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=1022 1022w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/zapier.jpg 1363w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Zapier</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My main task has been to work on integrating AIMM with other applications using an online business automation tool called <strong>Zapier</strong>. In a previous post, I explained that Zapier is essentially a site that provides an environment for companies to build API connections to their software. They can then use their application’s Zapier integration to connect it with other programs that are also connected to Zapier. Currently, Zapier has just shy of 4,000 programs connected to them, so there’s a wide assortment of available applications to connect with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The benefit of this is that custom connections don’t need to be written for each program that an application needs to connect to. Companies don’t need to coordinate and work together to build out interfaces. Instead, they build a single interface with Zapier and can then send data back and forth with any other application in Zapier’s ecosphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connectivity varies between programs. Some companies provide robust API connections, and others provide minimal connections. I’ve been working on connecting AIMM with <strong>QuickBooks Online</strong> and with a whitelabeled CRM called <strong>Salespype</strong>. Its been demoralizing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The development team has shared that AIMM’s backend was not designed well. Many of the developers have voiced concerns about how it operates, and after working with it a little myself, I concur with their assessment of the API being cryptic and difficult to use. There’s a planned rewrite of the API in <strong>Node</strong> &amp; <strong>Express</strong>, which I’ll be happy to see. The goal is to make it simpler by removing many deprecated endpoints, to enhance security and to make it RESTful. There are other issues that a rewrite aims to correct as well, but they’re security-related, so I won’t go into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve had a lot of trouble with authentication between Zapier and AIMM. Authentication is the first step in building an integration. Once that’s set up, other steps which allow data to be exchanged and actions to happen can be built out. I was able to configure outbound data transfer from AIMM to both QBO and Salespype a few weeks ago, but it took me even longer to get the reverse operations working. We do have bidirectional functionality now, but its in its infancy, with only customer data being shared between all three applications. There’s a lot more to connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Authentication is also not working as smoothly as I’d like it to. I can&#8217;t elaborate on that, for security reasons, but I’m currently trying to make it work the way that it should, and its not clear to me whether the fault is with how I’ve configured Zapier or with our API.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"648\" data-attachment-id=\"2227\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/readme-io/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1358,860\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"readme-io\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2227\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/readme-io.jpg 1358w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">User Guide</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another task I’ve been working on is writing the user guide for AIMM. I’m learning the program as I go, and I have a lot to cover, so I’m not happy with my progress in this arena either. Over the last three days, I wrote out instructions in the guide to walk end users through connecting AIMM with QBO and with the CRM. Ultimately, I think I’m going to end up personally setting up a lot of these connections though. There are some steps, especially where data has to be reformatted using tools provided by Zapier, that will be beyond the ability (and patience) of typical users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the plus side, I’ve been introduced to <strong>readme.io</strong>/<strong>readme.com</strong>, which I’m using to write the user guide, and I like it. It uses <strong>Markdown</strong> and some drag-and-drop components to create pages and has a table of contents and a page-specific contents section that automatically updates as pages and content are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"654\" data-attachment-id=\"2231\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/bcc-shop-page/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1359,868\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-shop-page\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2231\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bcc-shop-page.jpg 1359w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dissatisfaction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My main unhappiness at this job stems from two issues: (1) I don’t know this industry or application so my output is greatly slowed, and (2) I’m not doing as much coding as I had expected. The former issue can be overcome with time and familiarity with the program, but its not proceeding at a pace that I’d like. The latter issue is also something that can be overcome as my tasks change, but I don’t see it happening quickly as I&#8217;m quite literally writing a book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve written some code and made commits and pull requests to the application’s repo on GitHub. They were merged and are in the updated v1.1 of the program, but since I’m mainly working with Zapier and on the user guide, I’m not using my coding skills at the frequency that I’d expected when I joined the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve written some JavaScript in Zapier’s environment as well, but they use an older version of JavaScript (its not ES6) and I’ve largely been finding my way in the dark there. Some other developers have looked at Zapier with me, to help solve authentication issues and initial data transfer concerns, but for the most part, I’m swimming in uncharted seas and not having a great time doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve also been unable to dedicate the time that I’d like to on outside projects. That’s been a big letdown for me. I want to work on projects for my own web development company. I want to finish building out an ecommerce module for <strong><a href=\"https://www.breastcancercomfort.org/\">Breast Cancer Comfort</a></strong>’s website. There are a few other projects that I’d like to complete, and I really want to dive more deeply into <strong>Next.js</strong>, especially with v12 just having been released this week, but I’ve been completely drained of energy every weeknight, and I’ve been spending as much time with my kids as I can on the weekends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see from writing this that I need to improve my time management skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" data-attachment-id=\"2229\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/shopify-course/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1177,663\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"shopify-course\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2229\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=1024 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=150 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=300 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg?w=768 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/shopify-course.jpg 1177w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Upcoming</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, this has been something of a downer of a blog post. Hopefully, upcoming ones won’t be the same. I plan on writing a series of posts going through building Zapier integrations, to help other new developers navigate that process. I also want to write out a series of posts analyzing a fantastic ecommerce course I was working through, but stalled due to work. It uses Next.js, <strong>Shopify’s Storefront API</strong>, <strong>GraphQL</strong> and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> to make websites that are fast and responsive due to Next.js and business-ready thanks to Shopify.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a little more than 2 ½ months since I started my first programming job.
