It was a volunteer position with a breast cancer charity in Long Island. I met with the founder and her sister and we hit it off pretty well. I went over the site with them, explaining some of my thought processes in my redesign of their website and got some updated information from them which I ended up incorporating into the site the next day.</p>\n<p>Later in the week, the founder had to leave for a few days. She let me know that she&#8217;d be gone and she put me in contact with the person who had worked on their current site, which was built using WordPress. I reached out to her via email, and what happened surprised me. She basically related that they were going forward with the site that she&#8217;d worked on, which ran contrary to my understanding because on <a href=\"https://www.volunteermatch.org/\"><strong>VolunteerMatch</strong></a>, they had advertised that they were looking for a web developer to upgrade their site.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"1239\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/12/17/roadbumps-with-my-first-client-project/email-3/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"912,1262\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"email-3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=217\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=740\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1239\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=912&#038;h=1262\" alt=\"email-3\" width=\"912\" height=\"1262\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg 912w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=108&amp;h=150 108w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=217&amp;h=300 217w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-3.jpg?w=768&amp;h=1063 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" /></p>\n<p>I had looked over their WordPress site using the WordPress Administrator, and my assessment was that it had no prevailing design direction. There were unpublished pages, some with redundant information that was on live pages. There were published pages (some as old as 2015) that hadn&#8217;t been added to the menu system, so although they were &#8220;live&#8221; they weren&#8217;t accessible. Pages and blog posts seemed to be confused, and there were several pages with no content (and one with a single line of content).</p>\n<p>The WordPress person said that she didn&#8217;t want to make use of a website that was built using code, because she wanted anyone at the organization to be able to update the site and, from what I gather, she didn&#8217;t understand code, herself. My understanding was that this was specifically why they were looking for a web developer. But, in order to not step on her toes and make her feel diminished, I let her know that I would not then be a good fit for her group. What I bring to the table is specifically a basic knowledge of coding websites, which I hoped to put to use aiding organizations that I felt aligned with.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/12\\/17\\/roadbumps-with-my-first-client-project\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 139px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"139\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 218px; height: 139px;\" data-original-width=\"218\" data-original-height=\"139\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-1.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"214\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"135\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1233\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"913,578\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"email-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-1.jpg?w=913\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-1.jpg?w=214&#038;h=135&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"214\" height=\"135\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"214\" data-original-height=\"135\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"email-1\" alt=\"email-1\" style=\"width: 214px; height: 135px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 282px; height: 139px;\" data-original-width=\"282\" data-original-height=\"139\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-2.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"278\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"135\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1234\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"917,447\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"email-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-2.jpg?w=917\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/email-2.jpg?w=278&#038;h=135&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"278\" height=\"135\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"278\" data-original-height=\"135\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"email-2\" alt=\"email-2\" style=\"width: 278px; height: 135px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>I let her know that what she really needed then was just someone with knowledge of the WordPress interface, and, ultimately, good editing skills, who could organize the website and write content for it.

I told her that I&#8217;d be available to help advise if she had WordPress issues, and wished her well.</p>\n<p>So far, I haven&#8217;t heard from her, but I did get a message from the founder on FB Messenger, and two nights ago, I finally had time to reply. What we exchanged there was interesting, and reiterated in my head what I had told my wife when I had come home after my meeting with them: the organization means well, but they&#8217;re disorganized.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/12\\/17\\/roadbumps-with-my-first-client-project\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 639px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"639\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 229px; height: 639px;\" data-original-width=\"229\" data-original-height=\"639\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat3.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"225\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"635\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1235\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"611,1723\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-chat3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat3.jpg?w=106\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat3.jpg?w=363\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat3.jpg?w=225&#038;h=635&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"225\" height=\"635\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"225\" data-original-height=\"635\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-chat3\" alt=\"bcc-chat3\" style=\"width: 225px; height: 635px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 271px; height: 639px;\" data-original-width=\"271\" data-original-height=\"639\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat4.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"267\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"635\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1236\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"612,1458\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-chat4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat4.jpg?w=126\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat4.jpg?w=430\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat4.jpg?w=267&#038;h=635&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"267\" height=\"635\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"267\" data-original-height=\"635\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-chat4\" alt=\"bcc-chat4\" style=\"width: 267px; height: 635px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>So, it remains to see how things will proceed, but I think its been an interesting experience.

break, I was working on my portfolio upgrade, changing it over from JavaScript to React. I got stuck with something (conditionally rendering components) and hit Facebook for a little reprieve. While on there, someone in a programming group I&#8217;m in shared a link to <strong><a href=\"https://www.volunteermatch.org/\">VolunteerMatch.org</a></strong>, which I checked out. I found a cancer charity not far from where I used to work in Long Island. They have a website on WordPress, and were looking for a web developer to help improve it.</p>\n<p>I have a soft spot for clinical projects, because of my full-time job, and this also hit home for me because its a breast cancer charity, and my boss, who was one of the most inspiring people I&#8217;ve ever known, and who was like a second mother to me, passed two weeks before my older daughter was born, from melanoma.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.breastcancercomfort.org/home/\"><strong>Breast Cancer Comfort</strong> (current website &#8211; this might change to my redesign soon)</a></li>\n<li>[edit 04.24.2020] The live site has been using my design since Feb 10, 2020. I&#8217;m apparently their webmaster now. 😉</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I took it upon myself to research them online and go over their current website. I then built a simple one using mainly HTML and LESS (with a touch of JavaScript for the menu) based on their existing one. I used images and copy from their site as assets for my project, and then last night I contacted them on Facebook to let them know that if they still needed someone to work on their website, I was available and had already mocked something up. I sent a link to a deployed site on Netlify, and they got back to me about an hour later. They loved what I had done and are interested in working with me. We&#8217;re meeting on Sunday (4 days from now) at their office to present the site to the team and see how to proceed from there. 😉</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/12\\/04\\/i-got-my-first-client-project\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 201px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"201\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 201px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"201\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-oldsite.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"197\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1211\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-oldsite.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1119,894\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-oldsite\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-oldsite.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-oldsite.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-oldsite.jpg?w=246&#038;h=197&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"197\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-oldsite\" alt=\"Old website\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 197px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> Old website </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 201px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"201\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-newsite.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"197\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1210\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-newsite.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1119,894\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-newsite\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-newsite.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-newsite.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-newsite.jpg?w=246&#038;h=197&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"197\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"197\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-newsite\" alt=\"New website\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 197px;\" /> </a> <div class=\"tiled-gallery-caption\" itemprop=\"caption description\"> New website </div> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>My intention with this was two-fold. First, I wanted to add a project to my portfolio that wasn&#8217;t something Lambda-related. I really wanted a real-world project. The second was more psychological, and I realized it later that night. I didn&#8217;t complete my portfolio upgrade, so I felt like I hadn&#8217;t accomplished anything over Thanksgiving break. This gave me something to mark as a win. Even if they rejected the website, it was a small project that I could put on the portfolio and it wasn&#8217;t school-related. I could always call it a personal project &#8211; but now, I can actually add it as my first client one!</p>\n<p>I have an issue with what I&#8217;m going to present to them, but its nothing that can&#8217;t be remedied later. Its mainly that the site is a simple HTML/LESS project, so its not DRY (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself). I repeat the same code on every page (header, menu, footer) with some content being different. And on several pages, even though the content is different, the structure is the same. So, most of you know where I&#8217;m going with this: I feel like I need to rewrite it in React and make it DRY.  The header, menu, footer and some other parts should be components. The content for some of those components can be an array that feeds in text and images. I feel like I need to rewrite it as an SPA (Single-Page Application) which is likely something I&#8217;ll do over winter break.</p>\n<p>To those of you who want to work on projects, I suggest this, because its worked for me so far, and I intend to do it again: Find an organization that needs help with their website and just create one by yourself. When you&#8217;re done, present it to them. They can take it or leave it, but in the end, you can add it to your portfolio regardless of whether its adopted or not.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/12\\/04\\/i-got-my-first-client-project\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 336px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"336\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 260px; height: 336px;\" data-original-width=\"260\" data-original-height=\"336\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat1.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"256\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"332\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1214\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"576,747\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-chat1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat1.jpg?w=231\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat1.jpg?w=576\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat1.jpg?w=256&#038;h=332&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"256\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"256\" data-original-height=\"332\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-chat1\" alt=\"bcc-chat1\" style=\"width: 256px; height: 332px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 240px; height: 336px;\" data-original-width=\"240\" data-original-height=\"336\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat2.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"236\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"332\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1215\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"575,810\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bcc-chat2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat2.jpg?w=213\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat2.jpg?w=575\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bcc-chat2.jpg?w=236&#038;h=332&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"236\" height=\"332\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"236\" data-original-height=\"332\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"bcc-chat2\" alt=\"bcc-chat2\" style=\"width: 236px; height: 332px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>There are some things I plan on speaking about with them on Sunday. Some pages on the old website had no content (events, gallery, resources) so I didn&#8217;t include them in the redesign. Their contact page had an email address on it. I moved that to the footer. They have a second email address in their donations page, so I need to find out which is the one that they use and should be on the website. Two of the team members don&#8217;t have last names, and three of them have no biographies. There are incomplete promises on the site &#8211; one page mentions that donors who contribute $500 or more can opt to be included on a wall of fame on the website. That wall doesn&#8217;t exist yet. Their &#8220;Boobtique&#8221; says that they&#8217;re opening their doors to the public, but doesn&#8217;t give any details about purchasing yet. They also have a blog with a single post in it. We should either decide on a CMS (content management system) and use it or find somewhere better to include that post. There are also other resources online that I&#8217;d like to see if we can include &#8211; like other videos of the charity on local news stations. I&#8217;m also interested in any paper materials that they have printed, to see if information from it can be used on the website. Hopefully, on Sunday, some of these concerns will be addressed. It&#8217;ll be a fun project to work on, and I hope that an improved website helps with their online presence and growth.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://breast-cancer-comfort.netlify.com/\"><strong>Breast Cancer Comfort</strong> (my redesign and deployment on Netlify)</a></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>So, last week, during the Thanksgiving break, I was working on my portfolio upgrade, changing it over from JavaScript to React.

Patterns","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/29/design-patterns/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-j9","content":"<p>I have the week off from Lambda School due to Thanksgiving. To take advantage of that, I&#8217;ve been working on refactoring my portfolio site and upgrading it from <strong>JavaScript</strong> to <strong>React.</strong> I&#8217;m turning it into a <strong>Single-Page Application</strong>, but I ran into a little blocker that I&#8217;m trying to puzzle out.</p>\n<p>I took a break this AM and decided to just check YouTube and learn a little about <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern\">software design patterns</a></strong>, which are something that I&#8217;ve heard of but have no real understanding of. What I&#8217;ve learned so far makes them seem really useful for providing a design philosophy for how to construct components, or even what components to construct.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WV2Ed1QTst8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Design patterns basically exist to provide a paradigm about how data flow, component communication and relationships in an application should work. Following one is supposed to help reduce code complexity and safeguard against potential bugs by providing a known, predictable method of flow and of thought. It helps reduce the likeliness of spaghetti code and of two-way data flow, which I know from React is something to be avoided in preference of a <strong>single source of truth</strong> for the state of data. Its also supposed to make code easier to read.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I watched a video from the TechLead in which he spoke about some of his favorite design patterns. Afterward, the first two comments in the chat really stood out to me, and are the reason that I decided to post. Here they are:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><strong><em>veganaiZe</em></strong><br />\n<em>This is one of the most important, as well as overlooked, topics in software engineering. Tech focuses a lot more on the &#8220;Patterns&#8221; during this talk than on &#8220;Principles&#8221;. These software design patterns offer ways to accomplish certain behaviors, within a program, and also serve to benefit programmer communication. They all stand upon and are justified by principles.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>I think the most important principles are the following:</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>D.R.Y. &#8211; Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself &#8211; Pretty much self-explanatory. If you are re-writing the same block(s) of code in various places then you are ensuring that you&#8217;ll have multiple places to change it later. This is probably the #1 warning flag that you should look into an alternative/pattern.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>Y.A.G.N.I &#8211; You Ain&#8217;t Gonna Need It &#8211; Don&#8217;t code out every little detail that you can possibly think of because, in reality, you probably won&#8217;t end up needing much of it. So just implement what is absolutely necessary (save the GUI until later, for example!)</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>K.I.S.S. &#8211; Keep It Stupid Simple &#8211; When in doubt, make it easy to understand. Don&#8217;t try to build in too much complexity. If a particular design pattern overly complicates things (vs. an alternative or none at all) then don&#8217;t implement it. This applies heavily to user interface design and APIs (application programming interfaces).</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>P.O.L.A. &#8211; Principle Of Least Astonishment &#8211; This has overlap with KISS&#8230; Do the least astonishing thing. In other words: DON&#8217;T BE CLEVER. It&#8217;s nice that you can squeeze a ton of detail into a single line of code. But your future self and other developers will judge it by the number of &#8220;F&#8221;-words per minute when they open your source file. It should be relatively easy to jump into what your code is doing, even for an outsider who isn&#8217;t quite as clever as you are.</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>Last, and most certainly NOT least&#8230;</em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><em>S.O.L.I.D.

This one detailed some of the video, itself:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:40px;\"><strong><em>Isaac</em></strong><br />\n<em>1. @3:00 Break programs into logically independent components, allowing component dependencies where necessary. </em><br />\n<em>2. @3:10 Inspect your data objects and graph their interactions/where they flow. Keep classes simple. Keep one-way dataflow/interactions simple. </em><br />\n<em>@3:29 Simplicity &#8212; keep a small number of class types (controller, views, data objects) avoid creating classes that aliases those classes (managers, coordinators, helpers, handlers, providers, executor). @4:02 &#8212; Keep dataflow simple (e.g., don&#8217;t let Views have business logic; views shouldn&#8217;t need to communicate any data upstream). </em><br />\n<em>3. @4:33 Keep data model objects pruned of logic, except if the logic is part of the objects&#8217; states. Single Responsibility Principle. If you can&#8217;t describe a class&#8217;s responsibility straightforwardly, it&#8217;s too complex. </em><br />\n<em>4. @5:25 Inspect class composition (&#8220;follow ownership graph&#8221;). Follow the life of a child (composed) object to make sure that accessibility to and operations done on that object is managed. </em><br />\n<em>5. @5:55 Singletons (&#8220;basically globals floating in a system&#8221;). Use dependency injection (?) to &#8216;scope singletons&#8217; and make them testable (?). Singletons often represent independent (uncoupled) objects which is good for representing independent execution flow. Too many inter-communicating singletons in a system make it difficult to trace data flow and understand the overall transformation of the data through the system. </em><br />\n<em>6. @6:50 Singleton communication patterns. Singletons expose Publisher/Subscriber interface (one publisher object, many subscriber objects listening to events). </em><br />\n<em>7. @7:41 Delegate communication pattern. (?)</em><br />\n<em>8.@8:02 Chain of Responsibility Pattern. Hierarchical data flow &#8212; unhandled events bubble upwards to parent objects who should handle them. Conflicts with (2) by allowing upstream dataflow. Use with discretion. </em><br />\n<em>9. @8:53 OOP&#8217;s Inheritance can create tightly coupled hierarchical objects that are hard to refactor (object dependencies). Use composition pattern to allow flexibility in what the container object can do. </em><br />\n<em>10. @9:58 Lazy initialization. Startup performance boost. </em><br />\n<em>11. @10:06 Adapter Pattern. </em><br />\n<em>12. @10:26 Factory builder classes.</em></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1196\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/29/design-patterns/head-first-design-patterns/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"604,701\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"head first design patterns\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg?w=258\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg?w=604\" class=\" size-full wp-image-1196 alignnone\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg?w=604&#038;h=701\" alt=\"head first design patterns\" width=\"604\" height=\"701\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg 604w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg?w=129&amp;h=150 129w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/head-first-design-patterns.jpg?w=258&amp;h=300 258w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /></p>\n<p>While the above comments might not directly be design patterns, I think that their thinking can definitely inform best practices. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern\"><strong>Wikipedia</strong></a> has a list of design patterns available, and there are books and videos published on the subject.

School: Full-Stack &#8211; Build Week 1 and conflict resolution","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/18/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-ib","content":"<p>I&#8217;m in the midst of my second build week as I type this. Last time, with Unit 1, I was a website developer, so I created a marketing page for our project. This time around, with Unit 2, I&#8217;m a Junior <strong>React</strong> developer and I&#8217;m working on the application itself. I&#8217;ll write about that later, once we&#8217;ve completed this build week and after I&#8217;ve caught up with other Lambda-related posts that are backlogged (all of the <strong>Intro to React</strong> posts and <strong>Single Page Application</strong> posts).</p>\n<p>So, this post came about because of a talk I had with someone earlier today, and an experience I had over the past few months. A friend of ours is a CTO at a company that makes apps for children. He and I were speaking at a birthday party for one of our other friend&#8217;s kids today. I told him about Lambda School and explained where I was in the curriculum. He was especially impressed with how build week works, how we use GitHub to let us work together as a team on a single project, and with the payment system (the ISA and the requirements we need to meet before we have to pay for schooling, once its complete).</p>\n<p>During our chat, the topic of conflict at work came up. It tied into my first build week experience. I had told him that build week, for me, had a lot of positive points, but also some negative ones. This post explains the latter.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/\">Lambda School: Full-Stack – Week 4: Build Week</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The setup</h3>\n<p>When I flexed from full-time to part-time, I scheduled it so that I had about 2.5 weeks off before joining the next cohort. I did this because I wanted to go over JavaScript again, by myself, and also work on some projects before diving back into the curriculum. One of those projects was my portfolio. Initially, my portfolio was a project that we had to do in our 2nd week at Lambda. We picked a template from <strong>HTML5UP</strong> and modified it to turn it into a portfolio. It was meant to make us work with someone else&#8217;s code and to let us apply what we&#8217;d learned about HTML, CSS and LESS to something that we could actually use later on. My time off was the &#8220;later on&#8221; for me.</p>\n<p>I rebuilt the portfolio site from the ground up using only HTML and LESS. I didn&#8217;t yet know the JavaScript needed to manipulate the <strong>DOM,</strong> so I focused on what I did know and used the original site as a visual template for me to build from. My key drive was actually something that&#8217;s probably insignificant in the long-term, but it got me going: the original site was styled using <span style=\"font-size:inherit;\">elements that had diagonals in them that split containers into two different colors. I found out how to do that online, along with a bunch of other shapes and configurations, but it was that one little thing that got me started. I hadn&#8217;t seen anyone else in my cohort make use of that, and I found it unique and visually appealing.</span></p>\n<div>\n<p>It took me a while to &#8220;complete&#8221; the site. As we all know, a lot of these things are never done. I&#8217;ve updated it considerably since it was &#8220;finished&#8221;, but I always knew that would be the case, as the site was meant to grow with me. Anyway, at some point, I was updating projects on the site, and during testing, I found that the link to my build week 1 project no longer worked. The copy in my personal GitHub account worked, but the one in the team&#8217;s organization account didn&#8217;t. Neither did the links on my page that went to other teammates&#8217; websites. I chalked it up to internet issues and went about my way, not giving it another thought.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/11\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"212\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1180\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1173,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/1-1.jpg?w=246&#038;h=212&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"212\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"1\" alt=\"1\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 212px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"212\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1142\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1173,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2.jpg?w=246&#038;h=212&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"212\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"2\" alt=\"2\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 212px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<h3>Spider-sense tingling</h3>\n<p>A week or two passed, and someone from my first build week team asked a question in the team&#8217;s Slack channel: &#8220;Hey folks, anyone know where our potluck repos went?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This was followed by someone else answering, &#8220;I was wondering that too,&#8221; and other members of the team confirming that their repositories had also vanished. The person who brought it up was especially concerned, because he was one of the senior React developers and reproducing that work to show to potential employers would be difficult. One of the junior React devs added our TL to the channel, as he had left when build week was over.</p>\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t as impacted as the React people, because I had a copy of my project on my personal GitHub. It was what I had primarily worked from, and I had been copying my code up from there to the organization&#8217;s repositories. I felt a lot of concern for the team though, especially the React people, who would have had a much more difficult time than a website developer if the project had to be redone.</p>\n<p>I did some research and found that GitHub repositories don&#8217;t just vanish for no reason. There&#8217;s a deletion process involved. GitHub also permanently removes deleted data after 90 days, so our work might still be recoverable. I asked my regular group if anything like this had even happened to them, and no one had heard of it before. One of them offered a link that might help to recover the repositories.</p>\n<p>The fact that the organization had disappeared also sat unsteadily with me for another reason. As I had said in my initial account of build week, one of our team members had done this project for his first build week. He shared a link with the unit 1 students who were building websites to market the project. It was to a marketing site from a repository that had been built by one of the unit 1 students from his old organization. It was therefore about a month old and had not mysteriously disappeared.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/11\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"212\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1147\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1173,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"3\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/3.jpg?w=246&#038;h=212&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"212\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"3\" alt=\"3\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 212px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 216px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"216\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"212\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1148\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1173,1010\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"4\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/4.jpg?w=246&#038;h=212&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"212\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"212\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"4\" alt=\"4\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 212px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<h3>The trail leads to&#8230;</h3>\n<p>I confirmed that the build week organization itself was no longer in my teammate&#8217;s GitHub profiles, because it was missing from mine. This meant, of course, that the organization had been deleted, and with it, all of the repositories that it contained. The repositories, for those of you unfamiliar with GitHub, contain all of the work that our team did. We each had a repository (or, &#8220;repo&#8221;) with our code, and when it was ready, we could merge our code with the project&#8217;s master code, which was the essence of the group project and the whole point of build week. Only someone with administrative access to the account could delete a repo. Of course, you all know where this is going. Conflicts at work&#8230; no one else was asking the question, so I did it.</p>\n<p>Until now, our TL had been silent. I specifically called him out by &#8220;atting&#8221; him, which, in Slack is a message that tags someone. I asked him, &#8220;Do you know what&#8217;s going on here? Did you accidentally delete the group repos?&#8221;</p>\n<p>I was met with some hostility:</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1143\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/18/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution/bw1-tl-response/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"564,239\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"bw1-TL-response\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg?w=564\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1143\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg?w=564&#038;h=239\" alt=\"bw1-TL-response\" width=\"564\" height=\"239\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg 564w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg?w=150&amp;h=64 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/bw1-tl-response.jpg?w=300&amp;h=127 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 564px) 100vw, 564px\" /></p>\n<p>Bear in mind, I had asked if he <em>accidentally</em> deleted the group repositories.

what happened in his irate message in the channel. A second week passed with no update. A third week passed, and he finally responded to us in a thread where we were wondering aloud about what was going on and recounting what we actually did have to work with, with regard to personal repositories.</p>\n<p>In his thread response, he offered a .zip file with the backend that he had worked on and then reminded us of what we already knew &#8211; that our 2nd Senior React developer had shared links to what he had been able to salvage. He added that the back end had also been deployed to <strong>Heroku,</strong> a hosting platform, since early on.</p>\n<p>I had only completed unit 1 at Lambda. I was now working on unit 2, which focuses on JavaScript. I had no idea how to work with a back end or do anything with React, let alone reassemble the project from multiple people&#8217;s work on different repositories (of which not all had been accounted for). There was also no update about what progress had been made since he had been trying to figure out what happened.</p>\n<h3>Done waiting</h3>\n<p>Ok. Three weeks had passed with no substantive update. Two additional weeks had passed before that, in which the organization had gone missing, but we hadn&#8217;t yet brought it up as a group in Slack. Enough was enough. I didn&#8217;t have any confidence that our TL was invested in resolving this. He had most likely deleted the repos, for whatever reason, and was now hoping that enough time would pass that GitHub would permanently remove them and the entire incident could be chalked up to some nebulous mishap on their part. That wasn&#8217;t going to get our React people back their work.</p>\n<p>On the second week that we hadn&#8217;t heard anything from our TL, I had reached out to GitHub via the support link on their website, because I knew that we had 90 days to resolve this and didn&#8217;t know what their turnaround time was, either. I explained the situation to them, letting them know that I was a Lambda School student, had worked on a group project and was suspicious that our work had been deleted by our team lead. I asked if anything could be done on their part to restore the organization and our repositories.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/11\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 131px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"131\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 241px; height: 131px;\" data-original-width=\"241\" data-original-height=\"131\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-1.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"237\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"127\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1155\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"787,421\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"gh-email-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-1.jpg?w=787\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-1.jpg?w=237&#038;h=127&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"237\" height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"237\" data-original-height=\"127\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"gh-email-1\" alt=\"gh-email-1\" style=\"width: 237px; height: 127px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 259px; height: 131px;\" data-original-width=\"259\" data-original-height=\"131\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-large\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-2.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"255\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"127\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1156\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"781,387\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"gh-email-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-2.jpg?w=781\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/gh-email-2.jpg?w=255&#038;h=127&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"255\" height=\"127\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"255\" data-original-height=\"127\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"gh-email-2\" alt=\"gh-email-2\" style=\"width: 255px; height: 127px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<p>It took 20 days to get a response from GitHub, but when it arrived, it confirmed my suspicions. There had been no accident. I didn&#8217;t ask for confirmation about who had committed the non-accident, because I was focused on just getting the team&#8217;s work back. Unfortunately, they could not restore the organization at my request. That had to come from an owner of the organization.</p>\n<p>I went back to Slack and shared a screenshot of the email with the team. I asked our TL to please contact GitHub so we could get the organization restored. I went back to GitHub and asked if our TL could respond to the email thread or if he needed to open a new ticket. They informed me that a new ticket was needed, and gave me a reference number to include which would tie its history to my original ticket. I updated Slack with this information as well.</p>\n<div class=\"tiled-gallery type-rectangular tiled-gallery-unresized\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-carousel-extra='{&quot;blog_id&quot;:157470726,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;http:\\/\\/neophyte.home.blog\\/2019\\/11\\/18\\/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution\\/&quot;,&quot;likes_blog_id&quot;:157470726}' itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageGallery\" > <div class=\"gallery-row\" style=\"width: 500px; height: 192px;\" data-original-width=\"500\" data-original-height=\"192\" > <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 192px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"192\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"188\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1169\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1104,843\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"7\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/7.jpg?w=246&#038;h=188&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"188\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"188\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"7\" alt=\"7\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 188px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> <div class=\"gallery-group images-1\" style=\"width: 250px; height: 192px;\" data-original-width=\"250\" data-original-height=\"192\" > <div class=\"tiled-gallery-item tiled-gallery-item-small\" itemprop=\"associatedMedia\" itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/ImageObject\"> <a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg?ssl=1\" border=\"0\" itemprop=\"url\"> <meta itemprop=\"width\" content=\"246\"> <meta itemprop=\"height\" content=\"188\"> <img class=\"\" data-attachment-id=\"1170\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1104,843\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"8\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg?w=1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/8.jpg?w=246&#038;h=188&#038;ssl=1\" width=\"246\" height=\"188\" loading=\"lazy\" data-original-width=\"246\" data-original-height=\"188\" itemprop=\"http://schema.org/image\" title=\"8\" alt=\"8\" style=\"width: 246px; height: 188px;\" /> </a> </div> </div> <!-- close group --> </div> <!-- close row --> </div>\n<h3>A second opinion</h3>\n<p>Anticipating that I would continue to be ignored by our build week TL, I reached out to my original TL from when I was a full-time student. He had been my main adviser when I started the program and also knew a little about what had happened from when I posted in that group, asking the team there if anything like this had happened to them and gotten the response with the procedure to try (which didn&#8217;t work). I remember that one of the other people from my original group had also come to the same conclusion as me with the whole matter &#8211; he said that my build week TL &#8220;probably deleted it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>We Zoomed and I explained the situation to him. He said that first and foremost, he was appalled that anyone would act like this. Lambda vets their TLs and prides themselves on picking those who can support their teams. But also, as with any group that we&#8217;re part of in life, we have to deal with many personalities and situations. I broke down the lengthy time period without updates from the build week TL, and the confirmation from GitHub Support that the organization had been deleted. I told him that I was conflicted because in his original profile picture, I saw the build week TL&#8217;s daughter with him, and she was around the same age as my older daughter. I didn&#8217;t want to make some kid&#8217;s father into a villain, but he was hurting my team and wasn&#8217;t doing anything to correct it. I told him that I felt like I was making excuses for him by even considering this, what the build week TL&#8217;s workload might be like (I didn&#8217;t know if he really was up until 5:30 AM helping other teams, but it was hurting mine). I didn&#8217;t know if he had just overextended himself. The list went on.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, he said that I was doing the right thing. He said that it was commendable that I had reached out to someone for a second opinion before making any final decisions &#8211; something that he thought more people needed to do, and that it was also commendable that I had taken initiative with this. That&#8217;s something that had also made me feel a little uncomfortable with this whole situation. My work was relatively safe. Sure, it wouldn&#8217;t link out to anyone else&#8217;s, but I had all of it. I was doing this to help <em>everyone else</em> preserve their work. Thus far, I hadn&#8217;t received any backup from any of them. Two had actually made soft excuses for the build week TL. Until reaching out to my old full-time TL, I had been soloing the mission.</p>\n<p>It was a relief to hear his view and get acknowledgement that I was doing the right thing. He advised me to reach out to the other TL again and even offer to write the email to GitHub for him, because it takes all of the road bumps out of the way, although he didn&#8217;t know if this was overstepping and how it might be taken. He said make sure that I said the issue was time-sensitive now and to give him until the end of the following business day for a response, and if there wasn&#8217;t one, to escalate to <strong>Student Success</strong>. He finally said that Lambda don&#8217;t look kindly at this kind of behavior from TLs, although he had never heard of it happening before, and that it would also look good for me, because I was being responsible, stepping up and taking action.</p>\n<h3>Resolution</h3>\n<p>That last exchange happened on a Friday. I didn&#8217;t give the build week TL until the end of Saturday to reply. I gave him the entire weekend, and most of Monday. Of course, there was radio silence from him. I reached out to Student Success, to a person who I had worked with before to flex from full-time to part-time. In the afternoon, when I went to pick my daughter up from school, she messaged me back and we Zoomed in the car, before I drove home with the kiddo.</p>\n<p>I explained the entire situation to her, from the start, through the waiting, through GitHub&#8217;s messages and to my old TL&#8217;s advice that I escalate to her team. She said that when I had messaged her, she wasn&#8217;t expecting this, but that Lambda had systems in place to deal with it. I let her know that I had screenshots of the entire situation from Slack &#8211; they&#8217;re the ones with the user information that I edited out to make images for this post. I offered to send them to her when I got home. She agreed to see them, so 40 mins later, after I had gotten home and settled the kids, I sent them through direct message on Slack.</p>\n<p>We were originally going to have a follow-up Zoom after I sent the screenshots, but after review, she said that she had plenty of information to go off of. She would be working with another person in Student Success and would initially reach out to the build week TL and get the GitHub ticket going. She said that she appreciated that I made it simple for him to do that, and also know that it was time-sensitive. We could still meet if I wanted to, but considering that she had what she needed, I decided to let her have at it, instead of further taking from her time.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1164\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/18/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution/student-success-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"750,585\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"student-success-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg?w=750\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1164\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg?w=750&#038;h=585\" alt=\"student-success-1\" width=\"750\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg 750w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=117 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=234 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\" /></p>\n<p>I thanked my Student Success contact for her help and gave her kudos for my old TL. I told her that he was the blueprint for what a TL should be. I really think that he is. He invests in us, goes above and beyond to help us and offers sound advice. I really do appreciate his counsel. I also asked her, if possible, to have the build week TL include someone at Lambda in his emails with GitHub, to make sure that he actually was doing was was asked, considering how long he had been dragging his feet with my team.</p>\n<p>Three minutes later, she replied with a message from the other person she was working on this with. The build week TL said that he would take care of it, and that he was going to alert them when it was done. I suggested that if GitHub needs to assign an owner to the repo, that they include everyone from the team &#8211; something that my old TL had said had been done for some of his projects (it might have been a Labs project).</p>\n<p>The next day, it was done.</p>\n<p>There was a short message with no context from our build week TL on Slack that Monday. It simply said, &#8220;Sent in a new ticket.&#8221; I don&#8217;t know if anyone else in the channel would have known what it referenced. I thanked the TL with a &#8220;thank you&#8221; emoji.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday, one day after speaking with Student Success, the build week TL left a second message. It said, &#8220;Squared away. Everyone has an invite as an owner. Enjoy.&#8221; I thanked him for that as well. He left the channel, along with 3 other people from the group.</p>\n<p>I messaged Student Success, to close the loop, and thanked them again for their involvement. They really did get this resolved, when I was getting nothing. My experiences with them have been fantastic, to date. When switching from full-time to part-time, they offered a lot of information and had me flexed quickly, and now, when I let them know that a TL was causing an issue, they immediately took care of it. They really are a vital component that helps keep the gears at Lambda spinning.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1168\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/18/lambda-school-full-stack-build-week-1-and-conflict-resolution/student-success-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"768,405\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"student-success-2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg?w=768\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1168\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg?w=768&#038;h=405\" alt=\"student-success-2\" width=\"768\" height=\"405\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=79 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/student-success-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=158 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;m glad it got done. I received an email with an invitation to be an owner of the organization on GitHub from our TL. My assumption is that the others all did as well. Most of them have already rejoined.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m a little disappointed that no one else in my build week group stood with me. Its interesting to note that three of them have military backgrounds. I know that a lot of people in the military and on the police force have a tendency to not question authority, and to obey their superiors, hence the chain-of-command and all. I don&#8217;t know if that played a role in their not acknowledging that the organization did not delete itself &#8211; there&#8217;s a process to remove it, as one person in the group stated. They made excuses for the TL that weren&#8217;t based on evidence or following a trail. Maybe they were just being &#8220;nice&#8221; to him. Maybe it was diffusion of authority. I&#8217;ll never know. I&#8217;ll also never know why the organization was deleted to begin with.</p>\n<p>I also haven&#8217;t spoken with anyone from the group since all of this happened, so no one there knows my role in helping to save their work. That&#8217;s fine with me, but I wonder if the TL said anything to them, because 3 people left the Slack channel almost immediately with him. They probably think that he&#8217;d been working on this for weeks, to save their work. Its fine though. The objective was to get everyone&#8217;s stuff back, and to save the React developers from having to do what the title of my website actually says.</p>\n</div>\n","excerpt":"<p>I&#8217;m in the midst of my second build week as I type this.

Button clicks, drag-and-drop, using the mouse wheel, responding to keystrokes &#8211; all of this, and more, became possible with event listeners.</p>\n<p>Events are users interactions with a website. There are dozens of different events available to make websites interactive, and the browser is always tracking them, waiting for input. When an event happens on a page, its called a trigger.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Now that we know what an event is and we know the browser is always tracking them, we need to be able to listen for specific events on specific elements. Did a user click that button? Did a users mouse hover over an element? Was there text entered into the input field? There are dozens of events an element can listen for. And when one of those events happens on that element, we can do something about it. This is called an event listener. We put an event listener on an element and give it a callback. When that event is triggered on the element, the callback is run.</em></p>\n<h3>Event Listeners and Handlers</h3>\n<p>Specific HTML elements can be selected to listen for specific events and then fire a callback when that event is triggered. This is called an <em>event listener</em>.</p>\n<p><strong>.addEventListener:</strong> Once an element has been selected, the .addEventListener method can be added to it. .addEventListener takes two arguments. The first is the event to listen for, and the second is the callback to launch when that event is triggered.</p>\n<pre>element.addEventListener('click', callback);</pre>\n<p>There are many events across many categories available for the browser to respond to. Mouse events are the most common &#8211; especially those triggered by the &#8220;click&#8221; event, but network events, focus events, form events, keyboard events, media events, progress events, and other categories are available, each with their own selection of events to choose from. There are even (currently) niche categories like VR (virtual reality) events!</p>\n<p>Multiple event listeners can be chained to a single element, so its possible to have something like a button listen for a mouse click, keypress, hover and more at the same time. Each needs its own .addEventListener and callback, however.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events\">Mozilla Developer Network: Event reference</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The callback, or <strong>event handler</strong>, takes a single argument, called an <strong>event object.</strong> Its a JavaScript Object and contains details about the event and element that it was triggered from.</p>\n<pre>element.addEventListener('click', (event) =&gt; {//Event Handler});</pre>\n<h4>.target</h4>\n<p>A key property of the event object is <strong>.target.</strong> It contains all of the information about the DOM node that an event was triggered on. .target has many of the same properties as a regular DOM node: .children, .parent, .style, even deprecated properties like .innerText. These properties can be used to manipulate the element or its relatives in virtually any way.</p>\n<p>A simple example is changing an element&#8217;s background color:</p>\n<pre>element.addEventListener('click', (event) =&gt; { \n  event.target.style.backgroundColor = 'red'; });</pre>\n<p>Some events that are listened for include additional information that can be listened for, such as a code indicating a specific keypress. I&#8217;ve seen this used in online drum kit applications &#8211; an event listener waits for a keypress, sends the ASCII code or escape character for that key to the callback, and the callback plays a specific sound based on the key that was pressed.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event#Properties\">Mozilla Developer Network: Event Object Properties</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1100\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/03/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-dom-i/2019-09-03-04/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.03 04\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1100\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.03 04\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-04.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Event Propagation</h3>\n<p>Event propagation is a process in which an even is triggered on an object and then duplicated on every linked object going up the object&#8217;s branch until it reaches the uppermost level of the DOM. Basically, if an event is triggered on a child element, it is also triggered on every parent element, all the way up to the &lt;body&gt;. The event has to be the same for each of them for this to occur.</p>\n<p>An example is having a &lt;button&gt; inside of a &lt;div&gt; which is in another &lt;div&gt;. If each of these has a trigger, like &#8220;click&#8221; then clicking on the &lt;button&gt; will trigger a click for the parent &lt;div&gt; and the grandparent &lt;div&gt;, because they&#8217;re all overlapping on the same space, or branch of the tree. This can be a dangerous behavior, resulting in unwanted interactions, although in some cases it can be a feature.</p>\n<p>We can stop event propagation from occurring with a method called .stopPropagation(). If called in an event handler, it stops the event from bubbling further up the chain than the originally triggered object.</p>\n<pre>const eventHandler = (event) =&gt; { event.stopPropagation() };</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_bubbling\">Wikipedia: Event Bubbling</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sitepoint.com/event-bubbling-javascript/\">Sitepoint: What Is Event Bubbling in JavaScript? Event Propagation Explained</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>.preventDefault</h4>\n<p>I&#8217;m too tired to put this into my own words right now, so as per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Some elements have a native default reaction to certain events. For example, form elements will refresh the page on submit. .preventDefault is a method on the event object and it will stop an HTML element from reacting in its default way. This will be used less than .stopPropagation, but it is important to know about.</em></p>\n<p>Although I didn&#8217;t make much use of <strong>.preventDefault</strong> when it was introduced, it has come into play since starting the <strong>Single Page Applications</strong> unit at Lambda. We&#8217;ve used it to stop hyperlinks from loading other pages, keeping the browser from sending a network request to the server for a new page and instead rendering part of a page via a component, causing only a partial refresh. I&#8217;m sure there are other uses for it, but that&#8217;s been the most common use for me, so far.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>DOM II builds on the previous lesson and introduces us to events and event listeners, which bring interactivity and dynamism to web pages and applications.

JavaScript</strong>. It focuses on using JavaScript to manipulate the <strong>DOM</strong> to create rich user interfaces.

Its basically an API for the browser that depicts the HTML (and other) elements of a web page as objects called <em>nodes. </em>When we write HTML and it renders onscreen, its actually rendering through the DOM.</p>\n<p>The DOM takes each HTML element, whether its a &lt;div&gt; or a &lt;p&gt; or something else and turns it into an individual object, called a <strong>node.</strong> These objects have relationships with each other &#8211; mainly in where they&#8217;re placed onscreen via a hierarchy called a <em>tree structure</em>. Nodes have property keys. Some are purely informational, but others are methods which can be used to interact with the node using <em>event</em> objects.</p>\n<p>When a web page is loaded, the browser first reads the HTML file. It uses this to construct the page and then looks for CSS to style it after. The browser builds a model of how the page should look and behave using JavaScript &#8211; this is the DOM. Its a JavaScript object that contains every element (in order) on a page. The DOM is built as a data structure called a <em>tree.</em> Parent elements have nested child elements called <em>leaves.</em> Programmers can traverse branches of the tree to access specific leaves. Individual branches of the DOM can also be their own tree.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>When the DOM is built and the webpage is loaded, developers get access to it in the form of the global Javascript object <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">document</code>. <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">document</code> contains the entire hierarchy of the page, each element (or DOM node), and it also contains dozens of built in methods and properties. We can use these methods and properties to manipulate what we see on the screen.</em></p>\n<p>When I first learned about the DOM, it was interesting to me to learn that my HTML and CSS weren&#8217;t just being rendered as I wrote them. They were essentially passing through an intermediary that translated them into something else &#8211; namely nodes, which are objects. I didn&#8217;t see the point of it, but then I learned that, being language-agnostic, it allows different languages to be used for web development and still render page elements in a standard way. JavaScript is the dominant language, in this regard. While I can see the usefulness of this, it doesn&#8217;t impact me yet.</p>\n<p>What I <em>did</em> learn that affected my perception of the usefulness of the DOM is that page elements/nodes can be manipulated on the fly &#8211; which includes being newly generated or removed on the fly. This allows for the creation of dynamic content that interacts with the user &#8211; clicks, right-clicks, scrolling, drag-and-drop, hovering (which I did use with CSS, but is expanded upon with the DOM) and more. And that&#8217;s all with the mouse. Keyboards and other devices can also be tied to DOM events to allow for more robust or specialized application interaction.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model\">Mozilla Developer Network: Document Object Model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://eloquentjavascript.net/14_dom.html\">Eloquent JavaScript: The Document Object Model</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/whats-the-document-object-model-and-why-you-should-know-how-to-use-it-1a2d0bc5429d/\">freeCodeCamp: What’s the Document Object Model, and why you should know how to use it.</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1082\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/03/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-dom-i/portfolio-project-cards/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1017,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"portfolio project cards\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=1017\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1082\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=1017&#038;h=531\" alt=\"portfolio project cards\" width=\"1017\" height=\"531\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg 1017w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=150&amp;h=78 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=300&amp;h=157 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/portfolio-project-cards.jpg?w=768&amp;h=401 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1017px) 100vw, 1017px\" /></p>\n<h4>Portfolio</h4>\n<p>At some point, I&#8217;ll post about my portfolio more. Its a project that I&#8217;ve been working on over time and has had several refactors. The latest of these made use of what I learned in this unit at Lambda &#8211; namely, DOM manipulation and JavaScript <strong>components.</strong> The first incarnation of my portfolio relied on a template from <strong><a href=\"https://html5up.net/\">HTML5UP</a>,</strong> which we were asked to use as a basis for our portfolio project early on at Lambda. Later on, I took it upon myself to recode the entire thing from scratch, using only HTML and LESS, because I wanted to have more control of the site, and I wanted to reduce the thousands of lines of code that it included for features that I didn&#8217;t need.</p>\n<p>When I rewrote the site, each project that I included had its own block of HTML, which was absolutely not <strong>DRY</strong> (Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself). I basically copy/pasted the project HTML block, had it reference the same CSS/LESS as the other projects, and the site worked. As I added projects, the number of lines of code that I had to maintain grew, and if I added to the structure of the project cards (like, adding in the tech stack or just last week giving more descriptive names to each project and separating out the project&#8217;s sprint name or other category name, like &#8220;personal project&#8221;) I had to manually make that change by adding in the new HTML field to every project, across different pages and revising the text for each project, across different pages.</p>\n<p>Since refactoring the site to use components, I have a component that reads data from an array and renders each project. So, now I have a single component, which I can modify as needed, and each project is just 7 elements in an array, or one line of data (image, name, type, view URL, code URL, descriptor and tech icons stack). Its much easier to add new projects, change the format of the card itself and just maintain, in general. I have a different array for each page of projects (the ones on the home page, the HTML/CSS page and the JavaScript/React page) but I could also now easily merge all of these into a single array and add a field that lets the component know which page(s) to render a given project on.</p>\n<p>The small hamburger menu (the menu with an icon that&#8217;s 3 horizontal bars) at the top of my portfolio is also a component, which I just render around the top of each page. Later on, I&#8217;m likely going to refactor it yet again, using <strong>React,</strong> as a <strong>single-page application</strong>.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1094\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/03/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-dom-i/2019-09-03-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.03 01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1094\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.03 01\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-01.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h3>DOM Selectors</h3>\n<p>In order to manipulate elements on a web page and build rich user experiences, we need to be able to select specific nodes, or groups of nodes, on the DOM. Some elements can be accessed easily, like <em>document.head</em> or <em>document.body</em>. Others require the use of built-in methods to access more specifically.</p>\n<h4>getElement selector methods</h4>\n<p><strong>getElement</strong> selectors are the original methods for selecting DOM elements. They each take a single string as their only argument, containing the tagname, ID or class being sought &#8211; all HTML items.</p>\n<pre>document.getElementsByTagName('p');\ndocument.getElementById('idName');\ndocument.getElementsByClassName('className');</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>getElementByTagName</strong> will return an array-like object called an <strong>HTMLCollection</strong> which contains all of the page elements that are of the supplied type.</li>\n<li><strong>getElementById</strong> searches through the DOM and returns the specific element called.</li>\n<li><strong>getElementByClassName</strong> returns an HTMLCollection containing all the elements on the page that are of the supplied class.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>querySelector methods</h4>\n<p><strong>querySelector</strong> methods are the newest DOM selectors. They make use of CSS style selectors to return elements instead of HTML selectors. Both methods (getElements and querySelectors) allow selection by element, ID or class.</p>\n<pre>document.querySelector('.custom-style');\n<span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">document.querySelectorAll('queryString');</span></pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>querySelector</strong> will return the <em>first element</em> that matches the supplied value. If we pass (&#8216;some-style&#8217;) and not (&#8216;.some-style&#8217;) it will return an error. Remember the leading period for CSS classes!</li>\n<li><strong>querySelectorAll</strong> returns ALL elements matching the query string in an array-like object called a <strong>NodeList.</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>HTMLCollection vs NodeList vs Array</h4>\n<p>getElementsByClassName() or querySelectorAll() return either an HTMLCollection or a NodeList, respectively. These are referred to as ‘array-like objects’. The only other one I&#8217;ve seen so far is the arguments object in a function, which I didn&#8217;t realize was an array-like object until the Lambda text pointed it out. They both have numerical <strong>zero-based indices</strong>, and the <strong>length</strong> property, but that&#8217;s where the similarities with arrays ends. NodeList (which is returned from the querySelectors) does also have access to <strong>.forEach.</strong> There is no .reduce or .map or any other array method.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em><strong>Pro tip</strong>: The Array class does contain a method we can use to create an array from an array-like object, called .from(). To use this we would simply give .from the array-like object as it’s only argument.</em></p>\n<pre>Array.from(arrayLikeObject)</pre>\n<h3><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1097\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/11/03/lambda-school-full-stack-unit-2-sprint-5-dom-i/2019-09-03-02/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.03 02\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1097\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.03 02\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/2019.09.03-02.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></h3>\n<h3>Manipulating DOM elements</h3>\n<p>Being able to change live DOM elements allows us to update text, HTML attributes, or styles. Its a key tool in building interactive websites and apps. Once we have access to an element, we can manipulate it and change its characteristics, including those that weren&#8217;t initially set when it was written as HTML (like adding a class). After an element has been selected, there are dozens of properties and methods which can be used to manipulate it.

I&#8217;m pretty behind where I want to be, but here&#8217;s a quick update about my progress so far:</p>\n<p>Since switching to part-time, I thought that things would be easier, but I haven&#8217;t let them be that way yet. At home, I&#8217;m still stuck in much of my old pattern, watching the baby during the day and coding in the evening and night. I still come upstairs about 5:00 or 5:30 AM every morning, wake the wife up to start her day and then catch 2-4 hours of sleep with the baby &#8211; unless she&#8217;s awake, in which case I don&#8217;t sleep that day. Wifey takes the other one to school, so at least I&#8217;m not doing that regularly again. I do pick her up though.</p>\n<h3>Lambda School</h3>\n<p>Being part-time at Lambda is still a very different experience, socially, than being in a full-time cohort. The group I was with has already changed a lot. Four of the people who were in it when I joined are no longer there &#8211; they flexed into later cohorts, and different people have joined. Three of them were in Lambda longer than I was and already completed the material we&#8217;re learning now, so they know it more thoroughly. Mirroring my experience, they said that its been easier the second time around.</p>\n<p>I tried to be proactive and engage them in conversation more, and it looks like its helped a little with regard to socializing. One of them shared how he practices, both with Lambda material and with supplemental material, and another one was stuck on the same project that I was.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1057\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/10/26/general-update/fcc-cc/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1024,459\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"fCC-CC\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1057\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=459\" alt=\"fCC-CC\" width=\"1024\" height=\"459\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg 1024w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=67 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=300&amp;h=134 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/fcc-cc.jpg?w=768&amp;h=344 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></p>\n<p>The one who shared recommends <strong><a href=\"https://www.codecademy.com\">Codecademy</a></strong> more than <strong>freeCodeCamp</strong> because fCC has a lot of exercises but Codecademy also has what he described as &#8220;explanations in layman&#8217;s terms, which are easy to follow.&#8221; I&#8217;ve been meaning to go through both of these for a long time now, but haven&#8217;t made time yet.</p>\n<p>I made it through <strong>Applied JavaScript</strong> (and need to do my write-ups) and had a better experience, as it was my 2nd time.

I really need to review the material. Working in components makes sense to me, and I understand it, theoretically, but when it comes to actually implementing React projects, I have a very hard time. With part-time, we have 2 weeks to work through a unit, instead of 1 week, like we did in full-time. I was stuck on the 2nd project for an entire week. I literally made zero progress, even though every day I watched videos, read articles and even ordered a set of 6 small whiteboards so I could hash out program flow at my desk.</p>\n<p>I was about to give up and flex again when one of my friends from WEB23 who flexed into WEBTP10 and completed the project offered to help guide me through it. He did really well, because I completed some of it with him, and it was enough to help me understand how to do the rest. It was the Calculator project. We basically made a calculator using components in React. I think that, for me, a lot of the issue was that I&#8217;m new to React, so I don&#8217;t think in components as granularly as I could, and we were using files that had been provided to us &#8211; so it was basically someone else&#8217;s way of thinking when it came to setting up the project.</p>\n<p>With help, I did eventually get it, but that&#8217;s another area I&#8217;m very poor in. I don&#8217;t ask for help most of the time. Lambda has a 20-minute rule. If, after 20 mins, you&#8217;re stuck on something, you&#8217;re supposed to reach out for help. I generally hack away at things alone until I figure them out. In this case, it took me a week and I still wasn&#8217;t able to understand things, so its a weakness, not a strength. 40 mins with a friend did wonders for me. I was able to finish the project and then go through the materials for the next one (a project that makes use of NASA&#8217;s API, which I mean to work on this weekend).</p>\n<p>I had my Sprint Challenge yesterday, and did not complete it in the required 3-hour time. I was able to finally get it all working, but I think that if I had asked for help a week earlier, I&#8217;d be in a much better place now. I&#8217;d have had the projects completed, so I&#8217;d have had more experience with all of the material, and I could have probably implemented my design on the Sprint Challenge faster.</p>\n<p>Outside of my actual group, I saw a bunch of people leave WEBPT10 during the past two weeks. I know that React is one of the harder weeks for a lot of people. Some have flexed into other cohorts, to go through the material again, and some have withdrawn or gone on hiatus. One of the friends I made there, who started an extreme metal channel on Slack with me, left as well. He was going through the material more successfully than me, but his wife lost her job, so he had to switch from part-time to full-time at work and leave Lambda for the time being. I hear that Redux is going to be even more intense&#8230;</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1056\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/10/26/general-update/mentalhealth/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1800,1188\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"mentalHealth\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1056\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=1800&#038;h=1188\" alt=\"mentalHealth\" width=\"1800\" height=\"1188\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg 1800w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=300&amp;h=198 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=768&amp;h=507 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/mentalhealth.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=676 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1800px) 100vw, 1800px\" /></p>\n<h3>Mental health</h3>\n<p>In other big news, this week Lambda announced that they&#8217;ve partnered with <a href=\"https://www.joinmodernhealth.com\"><strong>Modern Health</strong></a> to provide mental health care to all students and faculty for free. I&#8217;m on the #mentalhealth channel in Slack and I&#8217;ve read about what the people there go through. Its a struggle for everyone, and coupled with many people&#8217;s living situations and personal obstacles and conditions, I&#8217;m amazed at how far a lot of students have gotten. <strong>Austen Allred</strong> (who founded Lambda) has apparently been reading the #mentalhealth channel, as have others who work there, and they actually went ahead and DID SOMETHING to help people there. I don&#8217;t necessarily need the resources (although that&#8217;s up in the air) but I really appreciate seeing others get the care and attention that they need. Already, there are people who have been connected with therapists and counselors and other mental health professionals and are in a better place, mentally, that they were only a week ago.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/the-commons/announcing-new-mental-health-benefits-for-lambda-staff-and-students\">Announcing New Mental Health Benefits for Lambda Staff and Students</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;m not aware of any other coding bootcamp that has done this for their students. Its really testament to how the school is willing to invest in students, and help them to succeed in their efforts. During the announcement, which was done through a 1-hour presentation, there were people in the #mentalhealth channel crying and just in utter amazement about what was being provided to them. Some hadn&#8217;t been able to see professional help in months &#8211; in some cases even longer than that, and were without meds or other support. Its a big stigma, here in the U.S. and I&#8217;m glad that there are institutions working to combat that.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1061\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/10/26/general-update/portfolio-v2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1010,649\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"portfolio-v2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=1010\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1061\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=1010&#038;h=649\" alt=\"portfolio-v2\" width=\"1010\" height=\"649\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg 1010w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=96 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=193 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/portfolio-v2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=493 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1010px) 100vw, 1010px\" /></p>\n<h3>Portfolio</h3>\n<p>I think that in a previous post, I mentioned that I had been working a little on my portfolio during the time I had off from Lambda.  I rewrote it from scratch using HTML and LESS and recently added in JavaScript components as a challenge to myself. All of the projects on the site are generated through a component that uses JavaScript to manipulate the DOM, as is the menu button at the top of the screen. There are tooltips and some of the icons for technologies used in projects were created in Photoshop and then styled using LESS. Its still not a professional portfolio, and I need to add in a few projects (which are now added in from an array that&#8217;s used to generate HTML, instead of being handwritten with HTML &#8211; it cut down on the size of each page and the repeated code, tremendously) from React Week, but its getting there. I want to add some small animations and two specialized HTML sections, but that&#8217;s work for the future. There&#8217;s also a good chance that if React doesn&#8217;t take my sanity in the next two weeks, I&#8217;ll look to refactor the site using it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://vishalicious213.github.io/Portfolio-v2/\">Portfolio</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other</h3>\n<p>Outside of everything else, kiddo #2 turned two years old last week.

So, since switching to part-time at Lambda School, I&#8217;ve been looking at how to continue writing about the experience. My main issue is that when I started writing, I was full-time, so it was easy to write about each day using a <em>Week# Day#</em> order. Part-time changes this a bit, because now any given day is two days long (minus the sprint challenges, of course).</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m going to begin naming each post based on the unit/sprint number and the lesson number. For orientation purposes, here&#8217;s a mapping of what I&#8217;ve written so far, with the published post name on the left and its equivalent with the new naming on the right:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Old name/Published name</strong></td>\n<td width=\"319\"><strong>Name under new ordering</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"638\"><strong> </strong><strong><br />\nWeb Fundamentals: Sprint 1 &#8211;

I&#8217;m going to begin including information from that course as well.</p>\n<p>I worked through the <strong>HTML</strong> part of Colt&#8217;s course, maybe two weeks ago and started the <strong>CSS</strong> part. Since then, other people from my Lambda cohort (and some from my group) have also flexed into different cohorts. I&#8217;ve been chatting with one of them in Slack and told him about Colt Steele&#8217;s course. He ended up getting the course and went through HTML and part of CSS as well, over a day or two last week.</p>\n<p>This past week, when we started working on the <strong>DOM</strong> at Lambda (I did this unit as a full-time student, but wanted to do it over again because between the DOM and <strong>Components,</strong> things weren&#8217;t sticking as well as I wanted) he skipped ahead to that section in Colt&#8217;s course and told me that it was really good. I started going through that section as well, this weekend, and I agree with his assessment. Colt has a different way of explaining topics from the instructors whose lessons I&#8217;ve watched at Lambda &#8211; probably because they&#8217;re going over the same course material, but slightly modifying it based on their own understanding vs Colt&#8217;s covering the material but using his own curriculum and experiences.</p>\n<p>Anyway, its a good pairing. I like how Colt explains things. Some of what he said simplified my conceptual understanding of the DOM and its really helped to cement basic selector methods for me. I&#8217;ll get into that in a post for that unit though.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Ok.

after about 2.5 weeks off, I&#8217;ve switched from <strong>WEB23</strong> (full-time) to <strong>WEBPT10</strong> (part-time). Its still a full-stack cohort, and its the same material, but the pace is slower and the schedule is different. For those of you who are curious about the differences, here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned and experienced so far:</p>\n<h3>Schedule</h3>\n<p>First, the schedule is different. Part-time is essentially twice as long as full-time. A 5-day full-time week is a 10-day part-time week. Also, we work for about 8 hours, full-time. With part-time, its something like 3-4 hours, and its fuzzier.</p>\n<p>Full time looks something like this:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Mon</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Tue</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Wed</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Thurs</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Fri</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Careers lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Sprint Challenge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Part-time looks like this:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Mon</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Tue</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Wed</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Thurs</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Fri / 5<sup>th</sup> Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">1-on-1 meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Careers lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Mon</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Tue</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Wed</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Thurs</strong></td>\n<td width=\"128\"><strong>Fri / 5<sup>th</sup> Day</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Lecture</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Sprint Challenge</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Guided Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Project</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"128\">Standup meeting</td>\n<td width=\"128\">&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Lectures are about 2 hours long, regardless of full or part-time. Careers lectures are about an hour long. With both types, guided projects happen as part of the lectures. With regard to projects, full-timers try to have them complete and submitted on the same day that they&#8217;re received, although, I generally took 2 days to finish mine. Part-timers have 2 days by default. Its fuzzier if you factor in time for those who work full or part-time, have kids, or have other responsibilities, in general, but overall, there&#8217;s more project time available for part-timers.</p>\n<p>With full-time, TL hours happen in the afternoons/evenings during the week. For part-time, they happen on the weekend. One of the big trade-offs is that, overall, part-timers have a little less class/lecture time, but they essentially have twice as much time to work on each lecture&#8217;s project as full-timers do.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1030\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/10/03/lambda-school-update-ive-switched-to-part-time/2019-10-01-03/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.10.01 03\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1030\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.10.01 03\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.10.01-03.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h3>Meetings</h3>\n<p>Coming from full-time, I was used to seeing my team every day during standup. I also had a 1-on-1 meeting with our team lead every day. This helped us bond very quickly and work well together as a team/unit. The experience is very different in the part-time group. I just had my first standup meeting last night. Only the TL and 3 other people were present. The others had been excused because of some other commitments. At most, we&#8217;ll meet as a team twice a week, and 1-on-1 meetings with my TL will occur every two weeks.</p>\n<p>Naturally, I can reach out to anyone I need to, if I want to speak with them more frequently, but in comparison to full-time, it feels something like a ghost town. I&#8217;ve noticed something of a disengagement due to this, from my first few days. In WEB23, our team&#8217;s chat was frequently updated. We shared resources, talked through coding issues, and just generally got to know each other and joked and supported each other. There&#8217;s not much chat in my WEBPT10 group&#8217;s channel. Maybe its due to personalities, but I think its also due to a more spaced-out meeting schedule.</p>\n<p>The general WEBPT10 Slack channel is similar. There isn&#8217;t much engagement outside of lecture time. So are the after-hours, chat and help channels.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t really want to do a direct comparison, but the TL&#8217;s methods are also vastly different. My old TL was very hands-on and supportive. He was also super-regimented. The new one is supportive in a softer way, and doesn&#8217;t get into technical discussions or share resources the same way at all. Maybe my opinion will change over time, but on Monday night, I was able to scroll up and read through the entirety of the group&#8217;s Slack channel in under 10 minutes. That would have maybe put me through 2 or 3 days of history with my old group&#8217;s channel.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"930\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-4/2019-08-22-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1051,720\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.22 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-930\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=1051&#038;h=720\" alt=\"2019.08.22 2\" width=\"1051\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg 1051w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=103 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=206 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=768&amp;h=526 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-2.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=702 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1051px) 100vw, 1051px\" /></p>\n<h3>Lecture</h3>\n<p>This is going to vary considerably based on the instructor, but I have quickly come to the conclusion that <strong>Britt Hemming</strong> and <strong>Christina Gorton</strong> really knew their material and went the extra mile to help us understand it. I already did the Advanced JavaScript unit with WEB23. I&#8217;m doing it again with WEBPT10, because I want to drill it into my mind. Its a completely different experience with my current TL.</p>\n<p>He&#8217;s way more laid-back, less-structured and doesn&#8217;t go into examples with the depth that my previous 2 instructors did. During the last lecture, he told us that some things might be possible to do, but Britt and Christine would have actually gone in and walked us through the things that he theorized about. I don&#8217;t think that he&#8217;s a poor programmer, but he might be new to teaching and less comfortable with coding on-the-fly with a big group, so it feels like he&#8217;s cutting corners. Its interesting too in that we had less breaks with him during the lecture, but I feel like we covered less material.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been watching the WEBPT9 lectures from <strong>Sean Kirkby</strong> and other lectures now. Because we have 2 days, I can afford the time, and I look at it almost like if I was having a lecture per day, like in full-time. Sean&#8217;s detail and regimen appeal to me. He also gives a more historical vantage of a lot of topics, which even Britt and Christina didn&#8217;t do. I think its because he&#8217;s been a developer for 25+ years, which also means that he was in the industry for the same period that I&#8217;ve been in I/T. A lot of what he explains is relatable to me.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1031\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/10/03/lambda-school-update-ive-switched-to-part-time/2019-09-10-01/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.09.10 01\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1031\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.09.10 01\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/2019.09.10-01.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h3>Initial conclusion</h3>\n<p>My overall feeling so far is that I&#8217;ve moved from the A-team to the B-team. I&#8217;m not the sharpest tool in the shed, myself, and the pacing works for me, but coming from WEB23, there were a lot more resources shared, more engagement from the cohort and the individual team and the TL, and it felt like we challenged each other more to work harder. I didn&#8217;t always meet these challenges, but I was able to benefit from seeing them and reviewing them.

I want the connectedness and support of full-time with the pacing of part-time.

School: Full-Stack &#8211; Week 4: Build Week","URL":"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/","short_URL":"https://wp.me/paEJkq-fN","content":"<p>So, my first <strong>Build Week</strong> at Lambda School was 3 weeks ago. Its a multi-disciplinary event that happens at the end of each unit. I don&#8217;t think any other bootcamp offers anything similar. Basically, students from different tracks get together and pick a project from a big menu of choices (at least 64 when I last checked) and create it. This means that when a student completes Unit 1, which is Web Fundamentals, that student then applies what they&#8217;ve learned towards the project. In my case, with Unit 1 under my belt, my task was to build a marketing website for our project. Students who are further along in the full-stack track perform other duties, like building the front end, building the back end, creating the data structure and database, and so on. We actually didn&#8217;t have people from other tracks join us, so there were no Android developers, iOS developers, data scientists and, surprisingly, no UI/UX people on our team. Some of that was due to the mix of available students, and I think some might have been based on the project itself. Other people from my regular group did have UX people (designers) on their teams.</p>\n<h3>Picking a project</h3>\n<p>The first step in the process was picking a project. We were given a URL to an <strong>Airtable</strong> site that had dozens of projects that we could work on. From there, we selected 6 projects that we were interested in and our TL submitted our names to them. The picks were ranked, so you had your first pick, 2nd pick, and so on. I mainly submitted for food-related projects, because I think with my stomach.</p>\n<p>The project I got assigned to was called <strong>Potluck Planner</strong>. Its a program that helps people to plan potlucks (surprise!). There were more serious projects, like one that helps NASA find planets, a diabetes manager, a deforestation app, refugee story app, world problems index, and so on. There were also more lighthearted ones, like Dad Jokes, which I would have probably also been perfect for, but in the end, I actually do have people over for potlucks quite a bit, so this was more up-my-alley (and my wife thinks most of my dad jokes are lame).</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"984\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/airtable-potluck-planner/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1155,897\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Airtable Potluck Planner\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-984\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=1155&#038;h=897\" alt=\"Airtable Potluck Planner\" width=\"1155\" height=\"897\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg 1155w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=300&amp;h=233 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=768&amp;h=596 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/airtable-potluck-planner.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=795 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1155px) 100vw, 1155px\" /></p>\n<h3>Meeting the team</h3>\n<p>I was surprised with how quickly we met our team. Within a few hours of getting my assignment, I was contacted by our build team&#8217;s TL. He set up a channel in <strong>Slack</strong> for us to meet and once everyone had joined, we scheduled an initial meeting for that evening. Some teams had a longer time getting set up, because for many (like myself) this was a new process, and also because we were just coming off our our <a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-5-sprint-challenge/\"><strong>Week 3 Sprint Challenge</strong></a>, so there were people taking the Challenge over again.</p>\n<p>So, we met as a team around 7:00 EST and got the breakdown of our group. We had 3 people from my cohort, which meant that there were 3 people working on a website for the project. There was no UX/UI person, no Android person, no iOS person, no data science student and no back end developer. We also had 4 React developers &#8211; I think that two were in Unit 2 and two were in Unit 3 &#8211; and finally, our TL.</p>\n<p>From what I learned both during the meeting and after, when I met with my regular group and also read through Slack, this build week wasn&#8217;t typical with regard to the distribution of students. There were a lot more web developers in my level than there were students at other levels, which is why we had no back-end and had 3 web developers. There were also far more full-stack developers than students from other tracks, but this might be normal. Lambda had dealt with this successfully before, but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;d had to for a while.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1006\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4.5&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NX20&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;33&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;400&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1006\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=1280&#038;h=360\" alt=\"schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web\" width=\"1280\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg 1280w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=150&amp;h=42 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=300&amp;h=84 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=768&amp;h=216 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/schnitzel-pork-cutlet-web.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=288 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></p>\n<h3>Planning</h3>\n<p>Our TL initially seemed to have a working structure for going forward. We sat as a team and went over design documents, figuring out what each person would contribute to the project. He also added us to a <strong><a href=\"https://trello.com/b/4zgrUJaE/potluck-planner\">Trello</a></strong> board, which is a web-based collaboration/project management tool. It was our main method of tracking progress, although we used the Slack channel too.</p>\n<p>From the first meeting, my personal feeling is that web developers at my level were somewhat left out, because we weren&#8217;t working on the application directly. We were providing a landing page that would eventually link out to the application. Some groups had all of the web developers work on a single site. Others had each web developer create their own website. Our team fell into the latter group.</p>\n<p>Our TL then divided the React developers into two teams, each with a junior and senior developer. The React developers and the TL got to work with speccing out the application, and the web developers were basically given the task to come up with websites to compliment and market the application.</p>\n<p>I left our initial meeting feeling a bit overwhelmed and directionless. My desktop had been having issues when running both <strong>Zoom</strong> and Slack, and had been blue-screening. Naturally, it did so during our first meeting, so I reconnected with the laptop, but had no resources available while I waited 20 mins for the desktop to recover. During that time, planning occurred, and I provided minimal input.</p>\n<p>One of the React devs had actually done this project for a <a href=\"https://potluck-planner-7-29-8-2.github.io/Web_UI/\"><strong>prior Build Week</strong></a>. He had a military background and stressed that one of the big features of his old team&#8217;s implementation was the ability to donate to the <strong><a href=\"https://www.woundedwarriorproject.org/\">Wounded Warrior Project</a></strong>. This seemed to become something of a requirement for this iteration as well, and with little-to-no real guidance from the team overall, I took it as gospel.</p>\n<p>Our initial design document fell short of what I was used to seeing at work. It had some basic functions, like a login and registration function, but no real description of the product&#8217;s overall functionality.</p>\n<h3>One is the loneliest number</h3>\n<p>During the meeting, when our TL decided that each web developer would work on his or her own version of the website, and that the React teams would each then decide which one they wanted to link to, I voiced a concern that my impression was that we were supposed to be working on this as a <em>team. </em>Creating 3 different websites that existed apart from each other didn&#8217;t feel like teamwork to me. I proposed an idea that if we have to each create our own site, we link to the others and treat their websites as &#8220;themes&#8221;. Our TL said that it was okay to consider that as a stretch goal.</p>\n<p>After the meeting, I reviewed our design documents and then I went to the Airtable list from Lambda and used the pitch and MVP details there to come up with ideas for how to structure my website. We had four days to work together and complete the project. Then it would be presented on that upcoming Friday.</p>\n<h3>Inception</h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"994\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/potluck-color-scheme/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"280,328\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"potluck color scheme\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg?w=256\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg?w=280\" class=\" size-full wp-image-994 alignleft\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg?w=280&#038;h=328\" alt=\"potluck color scheme\" width=\"280\" height=\"328\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg 280w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/potluck-color-scheme.jpg?w=128&amp;h=150 128w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 280px) 100vw, 280px\" />Feeling directionless, I decided to get a head start on things over the weekend. I ended up creating a Home Page and drafting an About Page. One of the few things that we had decided on concretely was a color theme. I took that and the project details from the Lambda website and sketched out my design. I then wrote copy for each section. By the time the weekend was over, I had a working website that met MVP.</p>\n<p>We had a short, optional, meeting on Sunday and I was able to offer more input this time around, as I Zoomed from the laptop and did everything else on the desktop. Our TL dove in and edited the design document, adding some structure and detail to it, and making it more of an actual features and task list than it was before.</p>\n<p>During the meeting, I let the team know that I had begun working on my website and that I&#8217;d taken direction about how to structure it based on details from the description on Lambda&#8217;s projects page. I showed them my initial site and was met with some gasps &#8211; I&#8217;d worked hard on it and the team was impressed. I told the other web developers to take anything that they wanted from my page &#8211; especially copy, if they were having a hard time coming up with copy for their own sites, and any other information from it. I asked the team for pictures of themselves with food, because I really wanted to tie food into the overall theme of the website, since it was a food-based app that we were working on. I also asked for their favorite foods, so I could include it in my About Page.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1007\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/array-of-eats-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"array-of-eats-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1007\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=1280&#038;h=360\" alt=\"array-of-eats-web\" width=\"1280\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg 1280w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=150&amp;h=42 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=300&amp;h=84 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=768&amp;h=216 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/array-of-eats-web.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=288 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></p>\n<h3>Process</h3>\n<p>Monday came and the rest of the team got started on their tasks. I was antsy to get pictures of the team stuffing their faces, along with the names of their favorite foods, so I asked for it on Slack. I only had one response. I know that everyone else was on Day 1 though, and I was effectively on Day 4, so I opted to not press it any further yet.</p>\n<p>The rest of the week was spent with me refining the page and helping the team a little. I initially had a single-color background for the site. I think it was the top one (#FFCC99) from our color theme. I found a way to create a gradient and use &lt;section&gt; to get it to spread down over the entire page. I used #FFCC99 in the header and #993366 in the footer, to blend and anchor them to the gradient. I applied it to the information boxes on the page as well, which led to a nice visual effect that my regular group would later comment looked like an optical illusion.</p>\n<p>As the week went on, I got pictures from other teammates, formatted them in Photoshop to make them all the same dimensions, and added them to the About Page. I added a <strong>hover effect</strong> so that the pictures would enlarge when moused over, and added a <strong>transition delay</strong>, to make the image zoom smoother. There were other small things added, like <strong>tooltips</strong> over the menu items, a <strong>favicon</strong> that appeared in the browser tab and a <strong>border-radius</strong> variant around the login and register section.</p>\n<p>Sadly, there were some stretch goals I set for myself that didn&#8217;t work. I had found and modified code that flipped a picture along the x-axis and displayed text on the back part &#8211; all using CSS. It worked, but when I expanded the screen width, it broke out of the container it was in and obscured the text below it. I tried a bunch of different things to correct this, but eventually gave up, which was a shame, because it was a really nice effect.</p>\n<h3>Inclusion</h3>\n<p>One stretch that I did make was adding the other two web developers&#8217; sites to my page as &#8220;theme&#8221; options. I did this using little CSS buttons at the top, in my navigation menu. I named them after the other two developers, and gave them tooltips. I did notice, afterward, that the other two web developers didn&#8217;t extend the same connection to my site, which was something of a letdown for me.</p>\n<p>I also wanted a way to connect with the apps from both React teams and finally decided to link to one as the &#8220;main&#8221; application and the other as a secondary server farm. I included the second application using CSS buttons, just like how I&#8217;d connected to the other two web developers&#8217; sites. The way that I decided to spin it was that the second set of login/register buttons would be explained as a backup system that could be used if the main site was down.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"1008\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/17/lambda-school-full-stack-week-4-build-week/chinese-thanksgiving-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1280,360\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"chinese-thanksgiving-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1008\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=1280&#038;h=360\" alt=\"chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg\" width=\"1280\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg 1280w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=150&amp;h=42 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=300&amp;h=84 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=768&amp;h=216 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/chinese-thanksgiving-web.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=288 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1280px) 100vw, 1280px\" /></p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>It took a little while for the team to warm up and work together. Initially, I felt like I was working in isolation, but by the end, each of the people on the team had found their niche, although web development was still somewhat apart from the rest of the team. Trello and Slack let us keep informed about what everyone else was up to, but my requests for pictures and favorite foods didn&#8217;t all get answered until almost the end; and I think it was helped along when one of the other web developers also asked for some of the same info.</p>\n<p>One of the React developers did host a 30-minute Zoom session with the web developers and I found it very helpful. We were able to learn a lot about their vantage from talking to him, and he shared a great JavaScript resource regarding <strong>immutability,</strong> along with giving us insights into what was coming down the pike for us still. It turned out that two of the other members of the team were also ex-military, but had been more low-key about it (I didn&#8217;t know about one of them until he submitted his picture for the About Page!).</p>\n<p>When I spoke with my regular team, we exchanged details about our Build Week teams and had a big range of experiences with regard to team makeup, communication, division of labor and work ethic. I think that, although my team wasn&#8217;t overly communicative early on, we still spoke enough to get work done over the course of the week.</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t get sample pictures of either React Team&#8217;s application, although I had limited access to one of them at one point. When we showed our work to our regular teams on Friday, our TL did let us know that, from past experience on other Build Weeks, he would not have had the React teams try to build two different applications. We ended up (as far as I know) with two incomplete applications. I think that part of the rationale for having a Build Week is to make us work in teams and have to deal with the intricacies of updating GitHub and managing branches and rolling out updates systematically. We didn&#8217;t really do much of that (at least from my experience) and I think that having the team work on different features of a single application could have served us better than splitting up the party.</p>\n<p>Our TL did rise to the challenge and solo the backend portion, to my knowledge, and we lost one of the React devs to a family emergency on the last day, so that definitely slowed down progress for one of the applications.</p>\n<p>One of my big takeaways from this experience is that next time, I&#8217;ll work harder to make sure that our expectations are more clearly ironed-out at the start. I also think that we shot ourselves in the foot by dividing efforts between two applications. We could have completed one, styled it nicely, perfected the UX and then worked on stretch goals. Another thing I would try to do is keep the web developers involved in the process. I think that, at least with design, all of the team could have had some input. There were also some interesting thoughts for stretch goals that never got implemented &#8211; like a way to flag food allergies. This could all have been more attainable with one larger group, instead of two smaller ones.</p>\n<p>So, my overall feeling is that I was more underwhelmed than not by the whole process. Bottlenecks included waiting on other people for input (like pictures and one-liners about what their favorite foods were) and not knowing what the React teams were working on. I&#8217;d have loved to have SEEN their applications while they were working on them. So, I&#8217;ll definitely be keeping all of this in mind for Build Week 2.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to a published version of my site.

A bunch of stuff has happened, but in a nutshell:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The full-time pace at <a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com\"><strong>Lambda School</strong></a> is too much for me to sustain any longer. I really tip my hat to the people who are able to learn at the speed at which it moves. They&#8217;re going to be electron-manipulating forces of nature when they&#8217;re done. Working until 4 AM so many days for the past 7 weeks (2 weeks of pre-course and 5 weeks of full-time) is beyond my capability to continue. I also don&#8217;t like being an absentee dad and husband, which I really turned into.</li>\n<p></p>\n<li><strong>I&#8217;m switching to part-time</strong>. It&#8217;ll be 5 days a week, for 3 hours a day, instead of 8 hours a day. It&#8217;ll take place in the evenings for me &#8211; either 6-9 PM or 7-10 PM, EST (I can&#8217;t remember which). There&#8217;s an additional 3 hour session every other weekend. What we cover in a week at full-time speed is covered in 2 weeks at part-time speed. Its got some trade-offs (mainly focused around course completion time), but ultimately, I want to come out of the other side actually proficient in what I&#8217;m learning, and cramming every day during the sprints isn&#8217;t conducive to that.<br />\n<br />\n<img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"974\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/14/lambda-school-update-im-switching-to-part-time/colt-steele-web/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"640,361\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"colt-steele-web\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg?w=640\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-974\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg?w=640&#038;h=361\" alt=\"colt-steele-web\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg 640w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg?w=150&amp;h=85 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/colt-steele-web.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\" /></li>\n<p></p>\n<li>While I&#8217;m on hiatus (part-time for me starts on the 30th of this month) I grabbed <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/\">Colt Steele&#8217;s Web Developer Bootcamp</a></strong> from <strong><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com\">Udemy</a>.</strong> I started it earlier today.

Week had me really worried. I didn&#8217;t think I was going to meet the minimum requirements to pass. I knew it was going to include problems for us to solve that would span concepts that we&#8217;d worked on all week, and I was particularly concerned with callback functions and array methods &#8211; and especially scenarios which combined the two. I had been dreading this day all week.</p>\n<p>I let my team know my concerns, and they all wished me well, but I know my limitations, and I struggled with projects every night this week. I&#8217;m the slowest person in my group, and I had only begun Day 4&#8217;s project on the morning before the Challenge, so it wasn&#8217;t even complete yet! The only thing I had going for me was that I was somewhat comfortable with prototypes, because for some reason the concepts had stayed with me since the pre-course.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"936\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-5-sprint-challenge/2019-08-23-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"591,107\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.23 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg?w=591\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-936\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg?w=591&#038;h=107\" alt=\"2019.08.23 1\" width=\"591\" height=\"107\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg 591w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=27 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=54 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 591px) 100vw, 591px\" /></p>\n<p>Well, the hour was upon us, and I prepared to go down fighting. We had 5 self-study questions to write answers for. I think I answered them first, this time around. Some were about the differences between certain array methods. Others asked for details about broader topics we&#8217;d covered during the week regarding functions, methods, closure, the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword and aspects of classes. I didn&#8217;t go into heavy detail with most of my answers. I tried to sum up their features in the most concise ways I could, for the most part, and then get into the coding parts of the Challenge.</p>\n<h3>Objects and Arrays</h3>\n<p>It turned out that there were four pages of programming tasks that we had to solve. They were focused on objects and arrays, functions, prototypes and finally, classes. I surprised myself with the <strong>objects</strong> problems by getting through them fairly quickly. It was something of a confidence booster and I thought that it was setting me up for a false sense of security with the next section. Basically, we were given data and had to create several objects, and then write code that used those objects to answer questions and finally, write a method for one of the objects.</p>\n<p>Next, it was on to <strong>arrays,</strong> which were on the same page as objects. In this case, we were (1) given an array and had to answer 3 questions using code that focused on array methods and (2) given another array and asked to answer 4 questions about <strong>advanced array methods</strong>.</p>\n<p>I referenced my notes from earlier in the week to answer these questions, and was relieved to find that the questions we were given were similar to some of them. I think I did have to go to <strong>MDN</strong> and <strong>w3schools</strong> for information to solve some of them, but enough time has passed that I don&#8217;t fully remember now. Each question in the advanced array method section actually told us which function it expected us to use to solve the problem, which helped me in a way &#8211; I wasn&#8217;t trying to figure out what array method to use to solve any given problem. Instead, I focused on syntax and usage for the method I was asked to use.</p>\n<h3>Functions</h3>\n<p>The functions section asked us to write a <strong>higher-order function</strong> and gave us the parameters for what it was supposed to do. Of course, it featured <strong>callbacks.</strong> Next, we had to create several functions to use as callbacks with the higher-order function. We were given specific instructions as to what these functions did as well. Finally, we had to run specific tests against out higher-order function and callbacks using provided data. I was able to make each of them succeed! I couldn&#8217;t believe it. The callbacks that we wrote were actually all in my ability to write without having to spend an inordinate amount of time on Google, researching, too!</p>\n<p>The bottom half of this page asked us to answer something about <strong>closure</strong> in our own words. I did some testing to see the effects of hoisting from several places inside and outside of the provided function and nested function, and I completed this section too. This was roughly the 50% mark, and while I don&#8217;t remember how much time I had left, I was happy that I hadn&#8217;t gotten stuck yet or made such poor use of time that I was left with only a few minutes for the last 2 sections.</p>\n<h3>Prototypes</h3>\n<p><strong>Prototypes</strong> came next, and I was able to directly reference the work from Day 3&#8217;s project to help solve the problems in this section. We had to create a <strong>constructor function</strong> that fit certain specifications to start the section. Then, we had to write two <strong>methods</strong> that returned specific data using information from prototype of the constructor that we&#8217;d just written. One of these had such a crazy formula requirement that I thought there was no way I was going to be able to implement it &#8211; but, luckily, I was wrong!</p>\n<p>Finally, we created a new <strong>object</strong> using the constructor from above with certain characteristics and tested it using those characteristics and the methods that we&#8217;d written for the prototype, above.I know I had less than an hour when I finished this part. I might have been down to 40 or 45 mins, out of our total of 3 hours.</p>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>The last section we worked on revolved around <strong>classes.</strong> I&#8217;d made it this far, and I was worried that this section would thwart my efforts to succeed because I hadn&#8217;t completed the previous night&#8217;s challenge, which was similar to one of the requests on the page.</p>\n<p>In this part of the challenge, we were asked to copy our prototype from the previous section and paste it onto the page. Then, we had to <strong>refactor</strong> it using class syntax. I had actually done this part of Day 3&#8217;s project, so I was able to reference it to replicate the process here. This included refactoring the methods I&#8217;d written, as well.</p>\n<p>After this, we created a new object that made use of the class and duplicated the properties of the object created in the Prototypes section. We then closed out by running tests against the new object that made use of the refactored methods that we&#8217;d written. It all passed!</p>\n<p>I had finished each section and I had about 10 minutes to spare! For the first time ever, I was able to look at stretch goals in each section and attempt them. I actually completed the stretch goal on the objects section! It was practically a watershed moment for me. 😉</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"946\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-5-sprint-challenge/2019-08-23-2/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"561,84\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.23 2\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg?w=561\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-946\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg?w=561&#038;h=84\" alt=\"2019.08.23 2\" width=\"561\" height=\"84\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg 561w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg?w=150&amp;h=22 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.23-2.jpg?w=300&amp;h=45 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 561px) 100vw, 561px\" /></p>\n<h3>Epilogue (because its the end of my Week 3 tale)</h3>\n<p>Towards the end of the day, we had our 1-on-1 meetings with Reed, our team lead. During our Zoom session, he asked how I felt I had done, and we walked through each of the sections. I was really happy with my performance. I had gone from readying myself to fail and move into the next cohort, losing my current team in the process, to not only completing the Sprint Challenge for the toughest week to date at Lambda, but completing a stretch goal! Reed noted that I had done really well, and after reviewing everything, he told me that I was getting a &#8220;3&#8221; for this Challenge &#8211; the highest grade! &#8220;3&#8221; means that I met all of the minimum requirements to pass and then went beyond and met at least one stretch goal. It was my first 3!</p>\n<p>So, I closed out the week by transitioning from panic mode and despair to actually giving my best performance. I would never have predicted this. And then, to top it off, we got our Build Week assignments. I&#8217;ll discuss that in the next post.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>The Sprint Challenge for JavaScript Week had me really worried.

The lesson was prefaced with the idea that since the original prototype system in JavaScript is clunky, classes were developed to simplify and abstract the process of achieving <strong>inheritance</strong> &#8211; which is really one of the key reasons that objects and classes exist to begin with.</p>\n<p>We were initially shown prototypes so that we could contrast it with classes more directly, in order to better know how both processes worked. We also explored the concept of <strong>pseudo-classical inheritance,</strong> which (to my understanding) (1) contrasts with <strong>prototypical inheritance</strong> and (2) uses constructor functions and the &#8220;new&#8221; keyword to basically &#8220;fake&#8221; a class and build objects. Prototypical inheritance, on the other hand, directly creates a new object from an existing object, without the use of classes at all.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://theoryapp.com/javascript-inheritance-pseudoclassical-vs-prototypal/\">TheoryApp: JavaScript Inheritance: Pseudoclassical vs. Prototypal</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Classes</h3>\n<p>I really dislike the phrase &#8220;syntactic sugar&#8221;. Its been used on every website that I&#8217;ve seen which describes what classes are in JavaScript. Kudos to whoever coined the term, but really, I wish people would come up with their own ways to describe how classes are implemented in JavaScript. ES6 has been around since 2015! It irks me the same way that every Western anthropologist who comes across a female figurine from another culture immediately ascribes its function as an idol to a fertility goddess. In 10,000 years, that&#8217;s how space-faring humans are going to view Barbie dolls when they return to Earth to see if they can clean up the mess we&#8217;re making right now.</p>\n<p>Anyway. JavaScript is a <strong>functional</strong> programming language. It relies heavily on functions and expression evaluations to operate effectively. Its a programming paradigm that contrasts with <strong>object-oriented</strong> programming, which is more focused on the creation and manipulation of objects and the functions and methods bound to them.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.educba.com/functional-programming-vs-oop/\">educba: Functional Programming vs OOP</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>JavaScript&#8217;s classes apparently aren&#8217;t true &#8220;classes&#8221; in the sense that other programming languages use the term. They&#8217;re just another way to create objects (hence, that &#8220;syntactic sugar&#8221; thing). They still have prototypes, properties and methods, and removing a method from a prototype still removes it from all of the instances of that prototype. <em>(Remember, too, that objects are also just variables that can contain many values.)</em></p>\n<p>My understanding is that in other languages, classes are the blueprints and are constructors in and of themselves. They also control inheritance &#8211; their properties and methods are passed down to members of their class. JavaScript simulates this by letting the class keyword create an object, which has its own properties and methods, and prototype, and can be <strong>extended</strong> to child objects, which can have their own methods, distinct from the parent object.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Class&#8221; in JavaScript mainly serves to streamline the object creation process, trading the creation of an object by use of the <em>function</em> keyword with creation of an object using the <em>class</em> keyword, and making other changes to keywords that are used to define methods, properties, binding and inheritance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://medium.com/@parsyval/javascript-prototype-vs-class-a7015d5473b\">Medium: Javascript : Prototype vs Class</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"931\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/09/01/lambda-school-full-stack-week-3-day-4/2019-08-22-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1366,768\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"2019.08.22 1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-931\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=1366&#038;h=768\" alt=\"2019.08.22 1\" width=\"1366\" height=\"768\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg 1366w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=300&amp;h=169 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=768&amp;h=432 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/2019.08.22-1.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=576 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1366px) 100vw, 1366px\" /></p>\n<h4>Class declaration and object creation</h4>\n<p>When a new class is declared, it looks just like any other object at first. The initial difference is that the <em>function</em> keyword is replaced with the <em>class</em> keyword and the property arguments are moved from the object&#8217;s name and placed inside of the function, with the constructor keyword. The first letter of the class&#8217; name is also capitalized, to indicate that its a constructor function. Inside of the function, the word &#8220;constructor&#8221; is explicitly used. Its the key tool used to build every object&#8217;s properties. These properties are bound to the &#8220;this&#8221; keyword when the object is constructed using the &#8220;new&#8221; keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>Object creation</strong>: (defines the constructor function and then creates two objects)</p>\n<pre>function ElectricBass(make, model, numStrings, handedness, color) {\n  this.make = make;\n  this.model = model;\n  this.numStrings = numStrings;\n  this.handedness = handedness;\n  this.color = color;\n}\n\nconst firstBass = new ElectricBass(\"Schecter\", \"Stiletto Studio 5L\", 6, \"left\", \"satin\");\nconst secondBass = new ElectricBass(\"Sterling\", \"Stingray SUB\", \"4\", \"left\", \"black\");</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_object_constructors.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Object Constructors</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Class creation</strong>: (defines the constructor function and then creates two objects)</p>\n<pre>class ElectricBass {\n  constructor(make, model, numStrings, handedness, color) {\n    this.make = make;\n    this.model = model;\n    this.numStrings = numStrings;\n    this.handedness = handedness;\n    this.color = color;\n  }// constructor\n}// ElectricBass\n\nconst firstBass = new ElectricBass(\"Schecter\", \"Stiletto Studio 5L\", 6, \"left\", \"satin\");\nconst secondBass = new ElectricBass(\"Sterling\", \"Stingray SUB 4L\", \"4\", \"left\", \"black\");</pre>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp\">w3schools: JavaScript Classes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#8217;ll write a follow-up post to this and contrast inheritance with classes vs inheritance with constructor functions, as that was a key topic of Week 3, Day 4.
