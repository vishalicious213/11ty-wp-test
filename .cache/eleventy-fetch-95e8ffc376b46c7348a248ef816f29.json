So, every time we create a paragraph, span, div or insert an image onto a web page (along with everything else we&#8217;ve learned so far, like ordered and unordered lists and headers) that element is enclosed in a box.</p>\n<p>The box that the element is in has 2-dimensional properties; namely height and width. Because of this it has 4 sides: a top, bottom, left and right side. We can manipulate the following properties of these sides via HTML:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>height and width</li>\n<li>margins</li>\n<li>border</li>\n<li>padding</li>\n</ul>\n<div data-shortcode=\"caption\" id=\"attachment_102\" style=\"width: 415px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-102\" data-attachment-id=\"102\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/15/lambda-school-full-stack-web-development-pre-course-5/box-model/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif\" data-orig-size=\"405,308\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"box model\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif?w=405\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-102\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif?w=405&#038;h=308\" alt=\"box model\" width=\"405\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif 405w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif?w=150&amp;h=114 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/box-model.gif?w=300&amp;h=228 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 405px) 100vw, 405px\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-102\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Box Model image, from the pre-course text</p></div>\n<ol>\n<li>The center of the box contains our <strong>content,</strong> be it text or an image. We can manipulate the color of the text, the background color and its height and width (generally in pixels).</li>\n<li>Surrounding the box is an area called <strong>padding</strong>. Padding is the same color as the background color of the content. Its thickness can be manipulated, which essentially puts something like white space around the content &#8211; albeit white space that&#8217;s the same color as the content&#8217;s background. The thickness of each side of the padding can be set independently of the other sides (for example, a thicker bottom, thin sides and medium-sized top &#8211; all in pixels) or it can all be set to the same thickness.</li>\n<li>Outside of the padding is the <strong>border.</strong> Think of it as a picture frame. We can control the width (thickness) of the border, its <strong>style</strong> (there are a bunch included in CSS, apparently, like solid lines, dashes and dots) and its color using color names or a variety of codes.</li>\n<li>Finally, there&#8217;s the <strong>margin,</strong> which is like padding, but outside of the border. Its invisible, so we can&#8217;t control its color, but we can control the thickness of each of its four sides. It essentially pushes the content, padding and border away from anything to any of its sides &#8211; its like personal space for a web page element.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I have a critique of this lesson&#8217;s video. Namely, it opens by creating a div in HTML with a paragraph in it. Text is added to the paragraph. This is all fine &#8211; however, then the div is assigned a <strong>class,</strong> with no explanation of what a class is, in either the video or the text. CSS is then used to manipulate this class and affect the div and its contents, hence the changes to its content size and colors, padding, border and margin. I think that &#8220;class&#8221; should have at least been briefly summarized so that those of us who are new to HTML and programming would have an idea of what it is.</p>\n<p>From what I can tell, it looks like it assigned a name to that particular div before its properties were manipulated. Since its the only thing onscreen, I don&#8217;t see the benefit in doing this instead of just manipulating the div itself, but I might be missing something without knowledge of what a class is and why one was assigned to the div.</p>\n<p><img data-attachment-id=\"103\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/15/lambda-school-full-stack-web-development-pre-course-5/precourse5-box-model/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1056,590\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"precourse5 &#8211; box model\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=1024\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\" size-full wp-image-103 aligncenter\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=1056&#038;h=590\" alt=\"precourse5 - box model\" width=\"1056\" height=\"590\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg 1056w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=150&amp;h=84 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=300&amp;h=168 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=768&amp;h=429 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/precourse5-box-model.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=572 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1056px) 100vw, 1056px\" /></p>\n<p>The video wraps up by explaining to us that the position and overall size of the content might change based on the dimensions of its surrounding properties. Basically, if we have content that 200 pixels wide and 100 pixels high, but we increase the size of its padding, border or margin, it makes the total element bigger and affects its placement onscreen (placement is changed visually mainly by increasing the margin size, since its invisible).</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QErnlkgkSzY?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

This small amount, coupled with some <strong>CSS</strong> is able to present almost everything needed by most developers on a web page.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;s also a style of design called &#8220;<strong>semantically correct</strong>&#8221; which uses all available HTML elements, particularly for accessibility and <strong>SEO</strong> (search engine optimization). That method isn&#8217;t covered in the course, but we&#8217;re asked to be aware of it.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.lifewire.com/why-use-semantic-html-3468271\">Lifewire: Why Use Semantic HTML?</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://html.com/semantic-markup/\">HTML.com: Learn How To Write Beautiful Semantic Markup – Perfect For HTML Beginners</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Attributes</h4>\n<p>HTML attributes are special keywords that modify the behavior of elements on a page. They provide information to elements which control their behavior. Sometimes these attributes are optional, and other times they&#8217;re required for an element to function properly (or at all).</p>\n<p>The first way that we learned to supply data to an element was to enclose it between two tags, like text in a &lt;p&gt;paragraph&lt;/p&gt;. Attributes are a second way, and are included inside of the opening tag of an element. The following section will show attributes in three new elements: anchors, images and unordered &amp; ordered lists.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_attribute\">Wikpedia: HTML attribute</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp\">w3schools.com: HTML Attributes</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>More Elements</h4>\n<p>1. <strong>Anchors:</strong> Anchors are written using the <strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/a&gt;</strong> tag. They allow developers to create links to other web pages or to areas inside of the current web page. Anchors are always modified with the <strong>href</strong> attribute to tell the browser what address a link must point to. The following two examples point to Lambda School&#8217;s website and this blog&#8217;s homepage, respectively:</p>\n<pre>&lt;a href=\"http://www.lambdaschool.com\"&gt;Lambda School&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/\"&gt;REDO FROM START&lt;/a&gt;</pre>\n<p>2. <strong>Image:</strong> The <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong> element is used to display an image onscreen. Like an anchor, it also requires the use of an attribute to let the browser know what image to display, and where the image is located (its name and address). This attribute is called <strong>src,</strong> or &#8220;source&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Image tags are one of the types that don&#8217;t need a closing tag &#8211; they&#8217;re <em>self-closing</em>. The whole tag can be closed by including a &#8220;/&#8221; before the closing bracket of the opening tag. The following example displays a picture of yours truly, from this blog:</p>\n<pre>&lt;img src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ready-player-1.jpg\"/&gt;</pre>\n<p>3. <strong>Unordered and Ordered Lists:</strong> <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;ol&gt;</strong>, respectively, create lists, which are essentially just bulleted (unordered) or numbered (ordered) lists. They&#8217;re closed using the <strong>&lt;/ul&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/ol&gt;</strong> tags. These elements set up the browser to expect a list. The items in the list are each included using the <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/li&gt;</strong> tags &#8211; for <strong>list item</strong>. List items can contain any element &#8211; they&#8217;re not relegated to text &#8211; so they can even contain images or other lists (essentially a nested list)!</p>\n<pre>&lt;ul&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Bread&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Eggs&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n\n&lt;ol&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Five golden rings&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;Two turtle doves&lt;/li&gt;\n  &lt;li&gt;A partridge in a pear tree&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ol&gt;</pre>\n<h4>Nesting Elements and Indentation</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We’ve seen in previous examples that we can nest elements inside of tags. In fact, this is a major part of writing HTML. Nested elements are referred to as children and the top level elements as parents. You will see this type of structure throughout your time writing HTML (and all code for that matter). One thing to note is that while indentation is not a requirement of HTML (nor of CSS and JavaScript), it is still often practiced as a readability issue. We not only write code for ourselves, but also for our teammates and those that come after us. Indentation lets your code be much more easily read and understood.</em></p>\n<p>Indenting, or nesting, code is a common practice across many, if not all, modern programming (and markup) languages. Its done to show what elements are part of a specific set of code, much like how an outline is used in writing for many disciplines.

Its one of the languages used for web development, and was the first language created to accommodate visual web browsers when they were invented in the 1990s. HTML isn&#8217;t a proper &#8220;programming language&#8221; because it doesn&#8217;t have commands to cause a computer to perform computation or processing or other tasks. Its a &#8220;markup language&#8221; which means that its primary function is to put data (be it graphics or text) onscreen for viewers to see.</p>\n<h4 id=\"whatarehtmlelements\">What are HTML elements?</h4>\n<p>HTML is comprised of elements. Elements are essentially containers with content on a web page. There are different types of elements/containers for different types of content. Some elements contain text. Some contain images, and others might even contain other containers.</p>\n<p>This segment of the pre-course focuses on the following four display elements: division elements (divs), headers, paragraphs, and spans.</p>\n<h4 id=\"howdoweusecodepen\">How do we use CodePen?</h4>\n<p>At Lambda School, HTML code is written using a sandbox coding environment called CodePen. HTML can be written directly in the HTML section of CodePen and the results of that code can be viewed onscreen, in real-time.</p>\n<p>This is quite a different experience from what I&#8217;ve had at work. Generally, I draft pages for our software using Expression Web, and then save my drafts and open them in a browser so I can view them in the same way that a client would. Its a different workflow from seeing changes happen live, like in a collaborative Google doc.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>CodePen also allows us to leave out a couple of critical elements: the <code>html</code>, <code>head</code>, and <code>body</code> elements. These are important to understand when we start writing HTML code in our text editors, but for now, we can ignore them, because CodePen handles them automatically.</em></p>\n<h4 id=\"whataretags\">What are tags?</h4>\n<p>HTML tags are keywords on a web page that are used when writing HTML code. Some coding languages have commands, and tags are essentially the markup language equivalent of commands. They tell the browser how to display web page items.</p>\n<p>Like commands in other languages, tags are essentially reserved words. They are enclosed in brackets, to set them apart from common uses of those same words. For example, &#8220;p&#8221; is just a letter, but &lt;p&gt; is an HTML tag which means <em>paragraph,</em> and is used as a prompt to tell the browser to display text.</p>\n<p>Tags encompass the text or other item they&#8217;re meant to display and must be <em>opened</em> and <em>closed. </em>Opening a tag is done by typing the tag along with its opening and closing bracket in our code: &lt;p&gt;, in our example above. Closing a tag is done in the same way, with a leading forward slash after the opening bracket, like this: &lt;/p&gt;. Text inside of the paragraph command is what&#8217;s displayed by invoking the command. For example:</p>\n<pre>&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a paragraph, even though its only one \nsentence.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>Most tags need to be closed after they&#8217;re opened, so they&#8217;re generally written in pairs with an opening and closing tag. There are, apparently, a few exceptions to this rule in which only an opening tag is needed.</p>\n<h4 id=\"sowhataredivsheadersparagraphsandspansexactly\">So what are divs, headers, paragraphs, and spans exactly?</h4>\n<p>Divs, headers, paragraphs and spans are HTML tags which are meant to display items on a web page. Pararaphs, headers and spans deal with text. Divs are generic containers used to group HTML elements together.</p>\n<p>1.<strong> Paragraphs</strong> are opened and closed with the <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;/p&gt;</strong> tags, respectively. They&#8217;re used to display text and by default will do so using a new line, instead of continuing from (or appending) to an existing line.</p>\n<pre>&lt;p&gt;This is an example of a \"paragraph\".&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>2. <strong>Spans</strong> are generic text containers. They don&#8217;t display text via a new line, like a paragraph, but instead continue from the last point that something was displayed. They&#8217;re used to &#8220;style&#8221; text in a web page, and often inside of other text. I think that this means that they&#8217;re used to display text that&#8217;s bold, or italicized or underlined, or a different font or size or color from the text around it.</p>\n<pre>&lt;p&gt;This paragraph contains a &lt;span&gt;very important phrase&lt;/span&gt; that \nshould be styled in some way&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<p>3. <strong>Header</strong> elements (not to be confused with the <strong>/head</strong> section at the top of a web page) basically denote the importance of their enclosed text by altering the size and boldness of that text. Think of them as section titles in a textbook or newspaper article.</p>\n<p>There are 6 header sizes, denoted as &lt;h1&gt; &#8211; &lt;h6&gt; with the largest being &lt;h1&gt; and the smallest being &lt;h6&gt;.</p>\n<pre>&lt;h1&gt;This is the \"most important\" headline.&lt;/h1&gt;\n&lt;h3&gt;This headline is less important, or is maybe a section header.&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;h6&gt;This is the \"least important\" headline.&lt;/h6&gt;</pre>\n<p>4. <strong>Div</strong> tags are used to group other tags together, often so they can be formatted all at once by another technology called <strong>CSS,</strong> or <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. So, they&#8217;re essentially a tag used for convenience by people writing web pages. So this means that <em>multiple</em> paragraphs, spans, or whatever else can be treated as a single unit and worked on all at once, without having to duplicate effort or code for each one, individually.</p>\n<p>In the below example, I had to misspell &#8220;div&#8221; as &#8220;d1v&#8221; because my browser is actually rendering my sample text as code and treating what I wrote as a real div, so none of the tags (the &lt;div&gt; and &lt;p&gt; tags) are showing up, but the text they encapsulate is. Le sigh&#8230;</p>\n<pre>&lt;d1v&gt;&lt;p&gt;This \"paragraph\" is about divs.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This paragraph is about divs too. Its a real paragraph since it\nhas more than one sentence.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;All three of these \"paragraphs\" are grouped together by a div, so\nif I ever learn CSS, I can style them simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/d1v&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id=\"howcaniinspectanexistingwebpage\">How can I inspect an existing web page?</h4>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>When learning HTML, it can be useful to investigate existing web pages. There is a tool built into every browser called the inspector that allows us to do this. Just right-click any element on a webpage and select “inspect” or “inspect element”, depending on the browser. This will pop up a sidebar that allows you to explore all the HTML on the web page. It can be overwhelming for a new developer, but it is a good way to get a taste of what goes into building a complex, production web page.</em></p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve done this in the past, and while most web pages do show HTML and CSS, some sites, like YouTube, show stuff that I can&#8217;t follow at the moment. It might just be a proliferation of HTML though.</p>\n<p>This is on my reading list for before the course starts, although at the rate I&#8217;m going, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll finish blogging all of this before class starts in a few weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/default.asp\">w3schools Tutorials on HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other languages/frameworks</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqoeTuPeQLQ?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

Its what we, as users, see onscreen when we access and interact with a web application or web page. Its sent to our browsers from an application&#8217;s server and is run locally on our computers, with results being sent back to the server for processing. Its also called the &#8220;client&#8221;. At work, I&#8217;ve heard it referred to as &#8220;client-side&#8221; as well.</p>\n<p>The main languages that are used in front end development are <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript.</strong> As per the text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>HTML allows us to put content on our page: text, headers, images, buttons, links, and etc.</em></li>\n<li><em>CSS is used to style our page. It allows the contents to have different text colors, background colors, as well as dealing with the positioning of the content on the page.</em></li>\n<li><em>JavaScript makes our page dynamic. It allows for the content to change on a mouse hover or click and also lets us submit data and have data rendered on our page (such as submitting a new blog post or having your feed populated when you open Facebook).</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>So HTML and CSS give us something to look at, and JavaScript adds interactivity and functionality to a web page.</p>\n<p>Front end work is essentially what I&#8217;ve been doing at my current company, although I wasn&#8217;t specifically trained for this position. Our developers wanted to code, not design. I worked a lot with our company&#8217;s founder, who drafted our interface on paper, long before I joined. I initially helped revise modules in our software, and later designed small pieces myself. Finally, when she was unable to do a lot of design work for herself due to illness, I stepped up and took over that role, relying on her knowledge and logic to guide me at first, and over time growing to rely more on my own, as well as federal and state regulation manuals and updates, and other industry standards. I joined Lambda School partly to learn front end coding so I could get better at this, or at least have an understanding of what was going on under the hood.</p>\n<p>My typical approach to front end work was initially to use <strong>Microsoft&#8217;s Front Page</strong> to design pages for our web application. After a while, I moved on to <strong>Expression Web</strong> &#8211; because Front Page was retired by Microsoft. As time progressed, I began to work with both Expression Web and <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. I did most of my design work using Expression Web, and later began placing variables into fields in the interfaces that I designed, to cut down on some of the work that our developers had to do. In truth, they were probably throwing me a bone, to let me work more with them, as I&#8217;m sure they could have done what I was doing much more quickly that I did.</p>\n<p>I used applications for interface design. By the end of this course, I hope to be able to understand the code behind all of it, and also be able to modify it by hand, and even write some of it from scratch, myself. Even now, I understand a little about how my lack of knowledge hindered my team &#8211; for example, since I don&#8217;t know CSS, I didn&#8217;t understand how to create a file with styling information that could be applied to multiple pages in our application &#8211; so all of the pages that I designed have information in them that affects colors of page elements, table formatting information, and other things that I could have centralized, to make the pages all smaller as well as to control from a single location, so updates could be applied globally with ease, instead of manually updating dozens of screens. There&#8217;s probably more that I could have done better that I still don&#8217;t know about.</p>\n<h4>What is meant by the term back end?</h4>\n<p>The Back End is where all of the server functions happen in a web application. This includes data processing &#8211; especially code that&#8217;s proprietary and hidden from the front end &#8211; saving and updating databases, and even communicating with other servers or applications. We don&#8217;t typically see or have access to the back end. Its essentially the server(s) or virtual server(s) that a web page or application runs from. When users send input from the front end to an application, it typically is received by the back end, processed, and an action is taken &#8211; like saving data into a database or computing an answer and then updating the front end so it can display new information.</p>\n<p>JavaScript can be used to create both front end and back end code. Other languages can also be used. Our company used <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Visual Basic</strong> for parts of its back end. Initially, it used <strong>Powerbuilder.</strong> Other common languages include <strong>Python, Java</strong> and <strong>Ruby.</strong> If a database is in use, it is also controlled in the back end using a database programming language, like <strong>SQL</strong> or <strong>Oracle</strong> (or, as the text states, <strong>MongoDB).</strong> Our company used <strong>Microsoft SQL</strong>.</p>\n<p>As per the Lambda School text:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>We will not be covering any back end within web dev 101, but the JavaScript skills we are developing are core building blocks to writing a JavaScript backend server. Back end development (including servers and databases) is covered extensively in the full course.</em></p>\n<h4>What is a framework?</h4>\n<p>Frameworks are extensions to programming languages. They add functionality to an existing language and can alter the syntax of a language. I don&#8217;t have any real knowledge of frameworks, but I know that the full Lambda course covers <strong>Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>React.</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>:</strong> Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrap_(front-end_framework)\">Wikipedia</a>)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://reactjs.org/\">React</a>:</strong> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/React_(JavaScript_library)\">Wikipedia</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What are unique challenges web developers face?</h4>\n<p>Working in any industry has its pros and cons, and software development is no exception. The Lambda text goes over three technical challenges that web developers have to contend with: load times, different browsers and accessibility.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Load times: Websites that take a long time to load frustrate users and can cause them to leave. Most users will leave a site that doesn&#8217;t load within 15 seconds. This can definitely affect business websites negatively, as well as other online applications &#8211; like those which collect important information, like medical or financial data. One alleviation is to learn methods to keep users engaged while a web page is downloaded, and to keep code lean so it downloads quickly (hence my CSS regret, earlier in the page).</li>\n<li>Different browsers: This is something we had to deal with at work, as well. Basically, different browsers interpret HTML in their own way. For example Internet Explorer and Chrome don&#8217;t always display pages in the same manner. Even Microsoft Edge can vary with Chrome in its page rendering. Mobile browsers are very different from those on laptops and desktops, and older browsers might not even support certain technologies that have become prevalent on the web. The text states that we will need to make sacrifices and not support some browsers &#8211; a decision often made by a marketing department. At work, we did just this by specifying what browsers our application supported and what version for each browser was the baseline. This had to do with support for a particular version of HTML as well as support for certain encryption technologies for security purposes.</li>\n<li>Accessibility: This has to do with people who interact with computers and the internet via special devices or technologies like screen readers, devices for colorblind or hearing impaired people, or those with other visual impairments, and those who use specialized keyboards and other devices to operate their computers. We need to consider how to enable them to use our software, not only for their own needs, but also to meet legal requirements for accessibility.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While the Lambda text goes over some technical challenges to web development, there are others that I&#8217;ve encountered at work. These are mainly related to meeting a client&#8217;s wants. There are many times in which clients don&#8217;t understand the scope of what software can or should do. All tasks appear &#8220;easy&#8221; to implement because, as the adage goes, &#8220;Nothing is impossible if you tell someone else to do it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worked with clients who had unrealistic expectations, which I&#8217;ve had to tamp down on. Generally, this has been successful. There are personalities, however, which simply don&#8217;t like computers or are obstructionist or even are working against a company because they favor another one. So-called &#8220;soft skills&#8221; are potentially a challenge for developers. They might not be meeting with end clients, although independent contractors certainly will, but even so, the ability to explain what can be accomplished in a certain time frame, or within a particular budget is invaluable to have when dealing with management as well as with clients.</p>\n<p>Prioritizing tasks is another concern. I&#8217;ve personally had entirely different feature roadmaps planned out than what our marketing team favored. Working with outside constraints, like changing government regulations is another challenge, especially when data has to conform to a revised format within a specific time frame. Dealing with the federal and various state governments for some of these updates can be a headache &#8211; are regulatory revisions finalized? Is all of the necessary information easily available? Is there a testing environment to which data can be submitted and a response can be gotten to confirm that revised code and data meets new requirements? Is there someone who can be reached (especially in a timely fashion) to provide guidance when needed?</p>\n<p>Its been my experience that technical hurdles can be overcome by a competent technical team. Dealing with people adds outside neuroses to the process, and has to be very tightly controlled, both to keep clients happy and to keep developers sane.</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zp__p0TYAAM?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School’s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

They need to be able to maintain, expand and debug existing software (or codebases, as the text states). They might also need to learn new languages or frameworks (language extensions) while on the job.</p>\n<p>The text also states that, &#8220;The greatest skill a software engineer must possess is being able to stay calm in the face of a complex problem, and using his or her own creativity (and with the aid of online resources), he or she finds the solution to that problem.&#8221; I&#8217;ve seen this validated with the programming team that I work with for my regular job (I write logic for our software, in English, not in a programming language, and wireframe modules, along with using design software to create the front-end). Customer requests are one thing, but changes to federal or state regulations, which require changes to our software, are sometimes very complex and we have to consider how these changes affect user data, not just going forward, but legacy data as well.</p>\n<p>Our team has come up with different solutions, based on the specific changes we&#8217;re asked to make. One solution includes branches of code which know <em>when</em> data was finalized and locked before the government needed it to be submitted, so our software then runs code which applies rules based on regulatory statutes for a given time period. For example, a change to some kind of data being gathered and processed might use a particular formula or read from certain data sources for submissions from 2010-2012, but then a revision was made to the formula which now affects submissions from 2012 onward, and then the data sources might have been changed in late 2012, so we have to read from new sources for part of the year and then forward, and then in 2017 certain fields might have been discontinued, or entire sections retired, and then in 2019 an entire new format for a section is created, etc.</p>\n<p>The team is able to come up with programmatic solutions pretty quickly, often to problems that initially would take me an entire morning to wrap my head around. Their calmness and ability to subdivide a task into smaller components has rubbed off on me over time, and I think has made me a stronger conceptualist.</p>\n<h4>How do we communicate with computers to accomplish tasks?</h4>\n<p>The short answer to this is that human beings use <strong>programming languages</strong> to provide computers with instructions as to how to perform specific tasks. The longer answer ruminates on the prevalence of computers &#8211; from smartphones and those now in our cars to more traditional laptops and desktops &#8211; and how they&#8217;re used for a vast number of tasks which most people don&#8217;t even consider the complexity or conveniences of while they&#8217;re using what&#8217;s essentially magic to get work done, or entertain themselves.</p>\n<p>Examples of what programmers instruct computers to do include &#8220;build a website, create an AI chess player, store and retrieve data in a database, and even drive our cars for us&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Three basic steps to writing code are also given, although specifics vary based on the task and programming language:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Understand the rules of the language</li>\n<li>Use those rules to construct a set of instructions (write a program)</li>\n<li>Allow the computer to read those instructions (execute the program).</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>How do we learn a programming language?</h4>\n<p>This section begins with the following preface:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>Learning your first computer language can be intimidating. It requires a level of precision that we may not be used to. However, just like human languages, the more programming languages you learn, the easier it gets.</em></p>\n<p>It then goes on to explain that in most programming languages, the core structure is made up of <strong>keywords</strong> and <strong>syntax.</strong></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em><strong>Keywords</strong> are special words built into the language that cue the computer as to what your intentions are. For example, in JavaScript the keyword ‘const’ tells the computer that you are about to store a piece of data in memory. These keywords are built into the language and are designed to accomplish specific tasks. </em></p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em><strong>Syntax</strong> is a built-in system of “grammar” that each language has. It tells us how we are supposed to construct commands, such as the word order and the use of symbols and punctuation (such as brackets, semicolons, and equal signs).</em></p>\n<p>Combining keywords and syntax allows programmers to issue commands which, when taken together, allow people to task a computer to perform an action or actions. Essentially, this is what allows us to write programs. Resources about keywords and syntax for a given language are often available online, usually through official websites or online repositories, which include examples of usage. Other resources, like YouTube, StackOverflow, and coding blogs, are also mentioned.</p>\n<h4>Which language should we learn?</h4>\n<p>This is actually a hotly-debated topic online. I&#8217;ve seen cases made for and against several different languages on Reddit, in YouTube comments, in Facebook groups and other places. Python is one of the big languages that are suggested for beginners, due to its ease of use compared to languages like C++ or Java.</p>\n<p>The Lambda School text for this section basically says that there are many different languages with their own structures and uses, and new ones are created when programmers find a current language lacking in certain functionality. Due to this, there are specialty languages for different areas &#8211; like web development, gaming, manipulating databases, and so on.</p>\n<p>The course will go over three web development languages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My understanding is that HTML and CSS are used for formatting web pages &#8211; placing text or images in specific areas, controlling their sizes and colors, and so on. I believe that JavaScript is used to perform actions with these page elements &#8211; basically, anything that&#8217;s clicked on, or otherwise interacted with by a human being, executes JavaScript code to perform those operations.</p>\n<p>The text closes with the following idea: <em>As you move through Lambda School and then your career, you will learn more languages as the need arises, but as we mentioned, the more you know, the easier it gets to learn a new one.</em></p>\n<h4>Where do we write code (text editors and sandbox environments)?</h4>\n<p><span style=\"color:var(--color-text);\">Code is generally written in text editors of some sort. Some are made to recognize programming languages and have special features built-in which will help format code, color-code certain words or otherwise help make code more readable to mere humans.</span></p>\n<p>At work, the team uses <strong>Visual Studio</strong> to do most of their coding. In previous versions of our software, the team used a language called <strong>Powerbuilder</strong> to write the software, and it came with its own <strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment\">integrated development environment</a> (IDE).</strong></p>\n<p>The text for this section says:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In most of Lambda School and our careers, we’ll be writing code directly in a text editor. Some great free text editors we recommend are Sublime, Atom, and VSCode. In this course, however, we will not need a text editor. We will be writing our code directly in sandbox environments (e.g., CodePen and repl.it). Sandbox environments are websites designed to allow you to write and immediately run small pieces of code. They are great learning tools for beginners and excellent debugging tools for experts.</em></p>\n<p>Here are links to the tools mentioned in Lambda&#8217;s text:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://atom.io/\">Atom</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://code.visualstudio.com/\">VSCode</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://codepen.io/\">CodePen</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://repl.it/\">repl.it</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>How do we execute code?</h4>\n<p>After code has been written, it must be fed to the computer so that it can be acted upon. This process is called executing, or running, the code. The process itself varies depending on the programming language. Some types of code are automatically run if opened using the right program &#8211; like opening an HTML file using a web browser automatically executes the code in that file. Opening a file written in a language like C++ in a browser would do nothing, however, as the browser doesn&#8217;t innately understand that language.</p>\n<p>From what I remember from high school, in the 1990s, some languages need to be <strong>compiled,</strong> or transformed from a human-readable form to binary (zeroes and ones) for the computer to be able to execute code written in them. Others can be executed by a program without being compiled. These are <strong>interpreted</strong> by software, like the web browser and HTML example, above.</p>\n<p>The Lambda School text for this section ends with the following statement:</p>\n<p style=\"padding-left:30px;\"><em>In this course, we will be using two sandbox environments to both write and execute our code: CodePen and repl.it. The first automatically runs our code as we write it while the second runs it with the click of a button. Executing our code will be very straightforward in this course. It’s something that we need to keep considering as we continue to grow as programmers.</em></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s some additional information about compilers vs interpreters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/\">GeeksforGeeks: </a><a href=\"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compiler-vs-interpreter-2/\">Compilers vs Interpreters</a></strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.programiz.com/article/difference-compiler-interpreter\">Programiz: Interpreter Vs Compiler : Difference Between Interpreter and Compiler</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q8TN6wOpOpA?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://neophyte.home.blog/2019/08/04/lambda-school-full-stack-web-developer-pre-course-index/\">Lambda School Full-Stack/Web Developer Pre-course Index</a></strong></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>There are nine units in Lambda School&#8217;s Full Stack Web Development Pre-course.

an online programming school/bootcamp called <strong><a href=\"https://lambdaschool.com/\">Lambda School</a></strong>. I discovered it in a video on <strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=97vVdQocLR0&amp;t=1s\">Joshua Fluke</a></strong>&#8216;s YouTube channel. The idea intrigued me &#8211; basically, they offer 5 tracks of study, there&#8217;s no upfront cost, and they claim a high (85%) placement rate in software development after completion.</p>\n<p>Classes/cohorts start every five weeks and last 9 months. For full-time students, its intense. You attend from 8 AM &#8211; 6 PM, Pacific Standard Time on weekdays, which equates to a full-time job. There&#8217;s a part-time option as well, which holds classes on evenings, and (I believe) a day out of the weekend. It lasts for 18 months. Some people on <strong><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/\">Reddit</a></strong> said that they prefer this option, because it gives them more time with the material, but I&#8217;ve been itching to move into programming, but I&#8217;m not learning well on my own, so I opted for the full-time schedule.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"63\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/07/06/lambda-school/lambda-tracks/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1053,749\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Lambda tracks\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=300\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=1024\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-63\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=1053&#038;h=749\" alt=\"Lambda tracks\" width=\"1053\" height=\"749\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg 1053w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=150&amp;h=107 150w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=300&amp;h=213 300w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=768&amp;h=546 768w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/lambda-tracks.jpg?w=1024&amp;h=728 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1053px) 100vw, 1053px\" /></p>\n<p>Yesterday, I received an acceptance email from the program.

These were the questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell us about your prior education (what schools you have attended, degrees you have achieved, etc).*</li>\n<li>Tell us about your work experience (employers, positions, titles, etc).*</li>\n<li>Which of the following best describes your programming experience?*</li>\n<li>Please tell us in one or two sentences about the most impressive thing that you have built or achieved.*</li>\n<li>Why would you be a good candidate for Lambda School?*</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I applied for the <strong>full-stack web development</strong> track, but I&#8217;m also interested in the <strong>user experience design</strong> track. Since acceptance, I&#8217;ve had access to the free pre-coursework material for the full-stack program, which I&#8217;m working through. Its a series of online texts and videos (which are also available on YouTube) with quizzes at the end of each unit (all require typed answers, like the initial application). You&#8217;re required to complete the material before the class begins.</p>\n<p>What I&#8217;m looking at, for the pre-course full-stack web development track, consists of <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> lessons, among general information about a developer&#8217;s role and mindset.</p>\n<p>This entire emerging environment of online learning is fascinating to me. I&#8217;ve used some resources in the past, such as <strong><a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/\">Coursera</a></strong> for learning about music theory and electric bass (see one of my <a href=\"https://uglybass.wordpress.com/\"><strong>other blogs</strong></a>), but this is my first foray into structured learning for a work-related reason. Lambda&#8217;s format seems a lot more interactive than what I&#8217;ve seen from resources I&#8217;ve used for music-related lessons. Its also a lot faster-paced and intense. Coursera, for example, was based on weekly lessons. Lambda utilizes daily lessons, and Coursera&#8217;s materials were only a few hours long, at the most, per week. Lambda&#8217;s is much lengthier.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll document my experience with Lambda as I find time to do so. My cohort begins in August. I have to verify the actual date, as different messages gave different start dates (Aug 4th, Aug 5th and Aug 12th). In any event. I have 4-6 weeks left before classes start, and my intent is to prepare with at least a generalized understanding of each of the technologies that the track teaches before I start. Hopefully, this is the first step towards a career-change into development work for me. We&#8217;ll see in nine months!</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>&nbsp; At the beginning of the week (Sunday) I applied to an online programming school/bootcamp called Lambda School. I discovered it in a video on Joshua Fluke&#8216;s YouTube channel. The idea intrigued me &#8211; basically, they offer 5 tracks of study, there&#8217;s no upfront cost, and they claim a high (85%) placement rate in software

a very informative Reddit thread from a person (<a class=\"_2tbHP6ZydRpjI44J3syuqC k9omvt-1 eTLhLs\" href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/numerous-nominee\">u/numerous-nominee</a>) who just landed a developer job:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/bb48n0/lessons_from_my_5month_job_search_tldr_great/\">Lessons from my 5-month job search (TL;DR &#8211; great offer from pre-IPO company)</a></p>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">I wanted to share things I learned from my most recent job search. It took much longer than expected (About 5 months start to finish) and I faced many rejections, but the end result greatly exceeded my expectations: An offer from a well-known pre-IPO company that was a huge upgrade in total compensation, brand-name recognition, title, and tech stack. <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Some of the following will probably be obvious to you</strong></em>, but some of this was new information to me. I&#8217;m an experienced dev and some of this might only apply to people already in industry, but some of it is applicable to new grads/non-traditional backgrounds.</p>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-0 jCDoIP\">About me</h3>\n<ul class=\"s14dydj4-12 iOgODC\">\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">BS in CS from a state university, definitely not an Ivy-league grad.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">5 years of industry experience, some shit-tier companies and some decent brand names, nothing at the Big N level.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Multiple technical internships before I graduated</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Young white male in SF Bay Area</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">I targeted mid/senior full-stack or back-end software engineer roles at pre-IPO and public companies rather than small startups.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">I did all of this while working as a full-time as a mid-level software engineer at a decently well-known tech company.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-0 jCDoIP\">Getting your foot in the door</h3>\n<ul class=\"s14dydj4-12 iOgODC\">\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Cover letters are 100% useless</strong>. Earlier on in my search I wrote cover letters for every application, it was a huge bottleneck. I gave up on writing them and quickly found that they had been useless, my response rate from applying directly on a company&#8217;s career page didn&#8217;t drop at all.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Messaging recruiters directly on LinkedIn was</strong> <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">astoundingly</strong></em> <strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">effective for getting a phone screening.</strong> Just search &#8220;&lt;company name&gt; recruiter&#8221; (make sure they are technical recruiters) and send a few of them a friendly message, you&#8217;ll get a reply from at least one of them in my experience. This worked great for companies that repeatedly ignored me when I applied directly on their careers website.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If you have a friend at a company you&#8217;re interested in, have them refer you. Doesn&#8217;t make passing the hiring bar any easier, just makes it faster to get your foot in the door with a recruiter. Most companies have referral bonuses for your friend if you end up getting hired, so don&#8217;t even feel bad about asking!</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">TripleByte really came through for me. I was <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">highly</em> skeptical of TripleByte, since I had applied in 2016 in a previous job search and got turned down, and didn&#8217;t agree with their assessment of my abilities at the time. I gave it a shot again this time around and got accepted. This ultimately is what led to me getting the interview that resulted in the offer I accepted. If you get accepted they generate a ton of leads (about 10) with high quality companies, and of course you get to bypass the initial coding interview. If you found this post helpful feel free to use my referral link: <a class=\"s14dydj4-27 gtWucc\" href=\"https://triplebyte.com/iv/Tt1YlBK/cp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://triplebyte.com/iv/Tt1YlBK/cp</a> The cool thing about the TripleByte exam is, pass or fail, they give you painfully, <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">brutally</strong></em> honest feedback so you know what to improve on.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">December/January are <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">really shitty</em> times to be job searching. Everyone&#8217;s gone for the holidays, companies don&#8217;t have head count yet for the next year yet. I lost a lot of momentum around this time of year but it picked up again in mid January.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Have some kind of system for tracking what stage you&#8217;re at with various companies. You will forget to follow up with people otherwise. I used a Trello board, and even then I accidentally let companies slip through the cracks occasionally.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Some companies will let you skip the phone screening</strong> if you&#8217;re anticipating offers with other companies. Google and Facebook did this for me. Once you have an offer on the table, the ball really gets rolling. Never be afraid to let recruiters you&#8217;re working with know about offers you have coming in, it makes you look like a strong candidate and they&#8217;ll work faster to bring you in.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If you&#8217;ve been waiting a while to hear back from a recruiter or aren&#8217;t sure what&#8217;s going on, just email them. They will never get so annoyed that they stop talking to you. <strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">When in doubt, just follow up.</strong></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-0 jCDoIP\">Interview Preparations</h3>\n<ul class=\"s14dydj4-12 iOgODC\">\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">I conducted my search while still employed full time, but <strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">I&#8217;m still undecided on whether or not it&#8217;s better to quit your current job while searching</strong>. I think only the individual can decide this. Your current job can be powerful leverage or it might just be weighing you down. In retrospect I think things would&#8217;ve gone better for me if I had quit since I have plenty of savings, but I didn&#8217;t know how risky it would be.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Leetcode is by far the best coding interview prep tool</strong> and a premium subscription is worth its weight in gold. The list of questions that companies ask is often incredibly accurate, but not always. Over my 5 month search, I solved about 250+ problems. In my opinion, do <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">NOT</strong></em> spend time on bit-manipulation problems, I didn&#8217;t get a single real-world question about them. All the other leetcode question topics are very useful (with the possible exception of &#8220;Math&#8221;, I did get some of those questions but they were less common). Hard questions are <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">relatively</em>rare in on-site interviews in my experience, so I would optimize for mediums, but do some hards if you have time. If you&#8217;re just starting out and feeling clueless, grind out some easies.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><a class=\"s14dydj4-27 gtWucc\" href=\"https://interviewing.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">interviewing.io</a> is a powerful tool. They let you do mock coding interviews with an actual human, as well as for-real coding interviews with brand-name companies that lead to on-sites if you do well (I ended up getting an onsite offer with WeWork from this but never followed through on it).</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">I strongly recommend using Python for interviews if you don&#8217;t already.</strong> Many top leetcode solutions are in Python. Python has pretty much all the data structures you need (heaps, counters, queues, dictionaries, etc.), it&#8217;s much faster to write and more human-readable than Java, and almost all interviewers will understand it. I truly believe it&#8217;s worth the time investment if you&#8217;re not fluent in Python already. One exception could be if you are looking for front-end roles and will be needing to write a lot of javascript.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">When I first started out, I seriously sucked at system design, and I still don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m great. The best resources in no particular order: Mock system design interviews with smart friends, Designing Data Intensive Applications (book), Grokking the System Design Interview (online reading materials, they&#8217;re behind a paywall but well worth the $70).</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\"><strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">Practice coding on an actual, physical whiteboard if you can</strong>. It is a separate skill from typing on a computer. If you don&#8217;t have one, buy one, it&#8217;s a good investment.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Once a company invites you to the final in-person interview, that offer is generally good for a quite a while, often a month or more. Don&#8217;t feel like you need to schedule it ASAP, do it whenever is best for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Invest in a good headset for phone interviews. I used AirPods and they work great.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Have multiple solid reasons for why you&#8217;re looking for a new job, because you&#8217;ll get asked this a lot.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Have good stories about things you worked on. Biggest challenges, how you resolved disagreements, things you would have done differently, etc.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Read up on offer negotiation: <a class=\"s14dydj4-27 gtWucc\" href=\"https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"s14dydj4-0 jCDoIP\">Onsite Tactics</h3>\n<ul class=\"s14dydj4-12 iOgODC\">\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If you&#8217;re like me, you will do very well on phone screenings, but <strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">you will face many rejections after onsites</strong>. My offer rate from onsite interviews was disappointingly low: I did 16 onsites in total over the 5 month period, and only had 3 offers to show for it. It wasn&#8217;t just me, this was also true of my smart job-searching friends that were working at places like Microsoft and Amazon. It gets discouraging, but it&#8217;s important to be able to handle the rejections gracefully. Not only will you get rejections, you might get offers that are disappointing and not worth leaving your current job for. The best advice I can give for handling rejection is to never get too excited about any one company. Always have another company in the queue to focus on instead. Frustratingly, most companies just won&#8217;t give you feedback so you won&#8217;t know for sure why they turned you down. I want to name and praise a few that gave me good feedback after rejecting me: Square, Lyft, Cloudera, Stripe, and Netflix. Always ask for feedback even if it&#8217;s not given initially.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Put your phone in airplane mode during the onsite. Calls or push notifications going off in your interview are very distracting.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If you find yourself with downtime in-between rounds, erase the whiteboard so you don&#8217;t have to do it mid-interview.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If the company wants you to do a coding exercise on your own laptop, the first thing you should do after checking in for your interview is to get on the guest Wi-Fi so you&#8217;re not doing it mid-interview.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">For the love of god, <strong class=\"s14dydj4-14 gBjHJP\">bring your own whiteboard pen to onsite interviews</strong>. Do not waste precious time playing the &#8220;which one of these whiteboard pens actually works&#8221; game.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">If you prefer to write code on a computer instead of a whiteboard, it doesn&#8217;t hurt to ask your interviewer if they will let you do that. Some of them will let you, though take note if they say they grade more harshly when coding on a computer.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Come prepared for anything you might need during the day in a backpack. Snacks, water, medication, etc. Most companies will have those but it&#8217;s no guarantee. <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">Always</em> bring your own laptop. I had a company *cough*Cloudera*cough* that said they would provide one for a coding exercise, and then didn&#8217;t have one for me when I showed up.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Take a bathroom break in-between <em class=\"s14dydj4-15 gYPNhq\">every</em> round, even if you don&#8217;t think you need it. It helped calm me down, and I was never distracted by having to pee during an interview.</p>\n</li>\n<li class=\"s14dydj4-11 iWgGqh\">\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Have a well-rehearsed list of questions to ask your interviewers when it&#8217;s your turn to ask questions. Otherwise there will be awkward silence and you&#8217;ll seem disinterested in the company. Obviously, have at least one solid reason for why you are interested in the company, they will ask.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"s14dydj4-10 kiAEUp\">Hope this was helpful, if you have anything to add or disagree with anything I wrote I&#8217;d love to hear it.</p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Here&#8217;s a very informative Reddit thread from a person (u/numerous-nominee) who just landed a developer job: Lessons from my 5-month job search (TL;DR &#8211; great offer from pre-IPO company) I wanted to share things I learned from my most recent job search.

discussed in Chapter 2 of <strong>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</strong> are <strong>break</strong> statements, <strong>continue</strong> statements and methods of ending a program that&#8217;s caught in a loop.</p>\n<h4>Break Statements</h4>\n<p>A <strong>break</strong> statement causes a program to immediately exit a loop&#8217;s block of code and go to the first line of code outside of that block. For example, the following program causes the computer to endlessly search for Dane McGowan. Once Dane is found, the program&#8217;s wait (and the loop) can come to an end.</p>\n<pre>while True:\n    print('With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?')\n    name = input()\n    if name == 'Dane McGowan':\n        break\n    print('You are not the one we seek.')\nprint('''We've been waiting for you, ''' + name)</pre>\n<h4>Continue Statements</h4>\n<p>A <strong>continue</strong> statement restarts a loop &#8211; I know, why didn&#8217;t they just name it <em>restart? </em>The following program searches for Dane just like the one above. It also uses a break statement to exit. Without the statement, it would be stuck in a loop and never know if it had, indeed, found who it sought (try it, comment out the break).</p>\n<pre>while True:\n    print('With whom do I have the pleasure of speaking?')\n    name = input()\n    if name != 'Dane McGowan':\n        print('You are not the one we seek.')\n        continue\n    break\nprint('''We've been waiting for you, ''' + name)</pre>\n<h4>Ending a Program</h4>\n<p>Sometimes, a program can get caught in a loop. This means that it keeps repeating a command with no way for the user to escape via available input methods. Its the digital version of living through Groundhog Day.</p>\n<pre>password = ''\nwhile password != '''Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn''':\n    print('Ia! Enter password to continue:')\n    password = input()\nprint('Iä! Iä! Cthulhu fhtagn!')</pre>\n<p>If  the above program is run, the computer will keep asking the user for a password until the correct one is entered. Most people won&#8217;t be able to spell the right password on their first try, or maybe even their 100th, causing them to get stuck in a loop asking for a password that they can&#8217;t type correctly.</p>\n<p>To end the program prematurely, and gain freedom from the loop, the user can press <strong>Control-C</strong> on the keyboard and manually break out of the loop and the program entirely.

Boring Stuff with Python</strong> is about flow control, which is basically <em>decision-making</em> in a program. Without flow control, when a program executes, it would run every command in its code, sequentially, until it reaches the end. Depending on the application, this could prove useless or even detrimental to the user. Flow control changes this so that intelligent or user-directed commands are executed instead, allowing programs to react to user requests or other environmental factors. To use a book analogy, its the difference between a traditional story and a choose-your-own-adventure book.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" data-attachment-id=\"28\" data-permalink=\"http://neophyte.home.blog/2019/02/04/atbs-chapter-2-flow-control/flowchart-ex/\" data-orig-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"428,531\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}\" data-image-title=\"flowchart ex\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg?w=242\" data-large-file=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg?w=428\" class=\" size-thumbnail wp-image-28 alignright\" src=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg?w=121&#038;h=150\" alt=\"flowchart ex\" width=\"121\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg?w=121 121w, https://neophytehomeblog.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flowchart-ex.jpg?w=242 242w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 121px) 100vw, 121px\" />Pictorially, flow &#8211; which is essentially the steps of any process &#8211; can be represented with a <strong>flow chart</strong>. This can visually present <em>starting</em> and <em>stopping points, branching points</em> and other information and is a strong tool for mapping out the logic of a sequence of events on a high level. Programmatically, flow is represented by <em>conditions</em> and controlled by acting on the values of variables at key junctures &#8211; namely, the aforementioned branching points.</p>\n<h4>Boolean values and Comparison operators</h4>\n<p><strong>Boolean variables</strong> can have only one of two values: &#8220;True&#8221; or &#8220;False&#8221;. Other data types (integers, floating point numbers and strings) can have a much wider range of values, but are often also evaluated down to a True or False value in order to execute a section of code.</p>\n<p><strong>Comparison operators</strong> are functions that look at the value of two values and determine whether or not they are equivalent. They use the following logical comparisons to return a True or False value after comparing two values:</p>\n<pre><strong>Operator     Meaning</strong>\n==           Equal to\n!=           Not equal to\n&lt;            Less than\n&gt;            Greater than\n&lt;=           Less than or equal to\n&gt;=           Greater than or equal to</pre>\n<p><strong>Boolean operators</strong> compare Boolean values. There are three of them: <em>and, or</em> and <em>not. </em>They follow <em>truth table</em> logic &#8211; remember that from 7th grade math?</p>\n<pre><strong>The \"AND\" Operator         The \"OR\" Operator        The \"NOT\" Operator</strong>\nTrue and True = True       True or True = True      not True = False\nTrue and False = False     True or False = True     not False = True\nFalse and True = False     False or True = True\nFalse and False = False    False or False = False</pre>\n<p>Boolean and comparison operators can be mixed together to create logic that essentially performs mathematical comparisons of values, evaluates them to true or false values and returns a single True or False value which can then be acted upon.</p>\n<p>A brief example of this from the book is: <em>(4 &lt; 5) and (5 &lt;  6)</em> which evaluates to <em>True and True</em>, and then resolves to <em>True.</em></p>\n<h4>Conditions</h4>\n<p>A <strong>condition</strong> is a more precise name for an expression and is mainly used in reference to flow control statements. Conditions evaluate down to Boolean values &#8211; either True or False. Based on this value, the flow control statement determines how a program should proceed. Essentially, the flow control statement is a branching statement or a decision point and the Boolean value passed to it tells it whether to turn right or turn left in its code.</p>\n<h4>Flow Control</h4>\n<p>Lines of code meant to work together can be grouped into units called <strong>blocks</strong>. Blocks begin with a condition and are followed by indented lines of code. They can be nested, which means that a block can contain other blocks &#8211; the indentation denotes what level of the nested blocks a given line of code falls in. Its different from other languages that I&#8217;ve seen in which indentations are visually helpful for humans to read code more easily, but not a mandatory aspect of formatting in the language. In Python, indentations <em>mean something</em>. I received errors when I tried typing blocks without indenting the right lines beneath an opening line of code.</p>\n<pre>spam=0\nprint('Enter 1, 2 or 3')\nspam=input()\n\nif spam=='1':\n    print('Hello')\nelif spam=='2':\n    print('Howdy')\nelif spam=='3':\n    print('Greetings')\nelse:\n    print('Hi')</pre>\n<h4>If/Else statements, While loops and For loops</h4>\n<p>The three most common types of flow control statements are <strong>If/Else</strong> statements, <strong>While</strong> loops and <strong>For</strong> loops. All three read like English and follow a straightforward logic:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>If</strong> statements: <em>If</em> a condition is true, execute the block of code that follows.\n<ul>\n<li>If statements can be followed by an <strong>&#8220;else&#8221;</strong> statement, which gives a block of code to execute in the even that the If statement is false: <em>If</em> a condition is true, execute the block of code that follows, <em>else</em> execute this other block of code.</li>\n<li><strong>Elif</strong> statements allow more than one <em>else</em> statement to be offered as an option in the event that an <em>if</em> statement is false. (<em>If</em> a condition is true, execute the block of code that follows, <em>else</em> if this other condition is true, execute this block of code, <em>else</em> if yet another condition is true, execute this block of code, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>While</strong> loops: <em>While</em> a condition is true, keep executing the block of code that follows. <em>(While</em> food remains on my plate, keep eating it.)</li>\n<li><strong>For</strong> loops: <em>For</em> loops execute a block of code a specific number of times. For example, if you&#8217;re lonely, you can run this code:</li>\n</ul>\n<pre>print('Say her name:')\nfor summoning in range(3):\n    print('Bloody Mary')</pre>\n<h4>Other stuff</h4>\n<p>The last part of the chapter deals with importing modules into Python. Modules are essentially files with additional functions in them that can be used to extend the commands/functions available when writing code. There are many modules available online already, and users can create their own as well. I&#8217;ll get into this at a later time, because its more focused on loading files and calling commands from those files than flow control.</p>\n<p>Videos 4 &amp; 5 in Al Sweigart’s tutorial on YouTube cover topics in chapter 2.

Boring Stuff with Python</strong> acquaints us with the standard editor used to type commands into Python. Its called <strong>IDLE,</strong> which is short for <em>interactive development environment</em>. It basically lets us write one-off lines of code and execute them. We are introduced to the concept of <em>expressions, values, operators</em> and <em>evaluation</em> &#8211; essentially the types of commands and/or data issued to the computer through lines of code, and the process by which they return output to the user.</p>\n<p>Math operators are discussed, and the order of operations is presented. We learn that when processed, python evaluates expressions down until it can return a single value to the user.</p>\n<p>After experimenting with math examples in IDLE, we learn a little about three <em>data types: integer,</em> <em>floating point</em> and <em>string. </em>Integers are whole numbers. Floating point values are decimals and string is, of course, alphanumeric. I&#8217;ve seen similar designations in other languages, often as integer, real number and string.</p>\n<pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Bat' + 'man'\n'Batman'\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; 'Hastur' * 5\n'HasturHasturHasturHasturHastur'</pre>\n<p>Glancing at the table of contents, we see sections on string concatenation and replication (see above example), storing values in variables, assignment statements, variable names, comments, the print() function, the input() function, the len() function and the str(), int() and float() functions.</p>\n<p>After the section on variable names, the <strong>file editor</strong> is introduced. It looks like, and is launched from, IDLE, but code typed into it does not immediately execute. Instead, it works like a word processor, letting us type multiple commands and save them to a file, which can then be executed and is run in IDLE.</p>\n<pre>hello world</pre>\n<p>This is the point in which we actually begin writing code. We get to write a program that asks for a person&#8217;s name, lets the user enter a name, and then responds to the user with a greeting using that name and telling the user how many letters are in the name as well as how old the user will be in a year &#8211; something a little more involved than the classic &#8220;hello world&#8221; introductory program that I grew up with.</p>\n<p>After running the program and getting a feel for how it works, the text goes over each command, explaining how they each work and giving the user further examples of each to experiment with. I found this interesting, especially when working with numeric and text values together, since they don&#8217;t necessarily play in the same field without some kind of conversion to make them the same.</p>\n<p>The first 3 videos in Al Sweigart&#8217;s tutorial on YouTube cover the topics in chapter 1. They can be found here:</p>\n<p>Lesson 1 (intro):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1F_OgqRuSdI?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Lesson 2 (expressions, data types, and variables):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7qHMXu99d88?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n<p>Lesson 3 (writing your first &#8220;Hello World&#8221; program in Python):</p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/buMTH6ICnqk?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;fs=1&#038;hl=en&#038;autohide=2&#038;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></span></p>\n","excerpt":"<p>Chapter 1 of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python acquaints us with the standard editor used to type commands into Python.

directly touched code. After watching a bunch of YouTube videos and reading articles about getting back into programming, I decided to start with what&#8217;s considered the most-easily-grasped language today: <strong>Python.</strong> During my research, one of the most-recommended books to begin learning with was <strong>Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</strong>, by <strong>Al Sweigart</strong>. The book is rated well on Amazon, but was also released under the Creative Commons license, so its available online and in PDF format, for free.</p>\n<p>I skimmed the PDF of the book and found it intriguing, so I started working through it, discovering two complimentary resources along the way: (1) a YouTube walk-through of the beginning chapters of the book by the author, and (2) a full course centered around the book, by the author, hosted at <strong>Udemy,</strong> an online learning site.</p>\n<p>Over the past few days, I followed the YouTube videos, working through them and their associated chapters in the book. I then started the process over again using only the book, to see if it was different &#8211; the content is the same, but there are details provided on YouTube and in the text which differ slightly. In a few days, I plan to begin the Udemy course, which costed $10 and is comprised of 51 lessons, which run at 9.5 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>[edit]</strong> The YouTube videos are the first 15 videos from the Udemy course.</p>\n<p>So far, the opening chapters have not been difficult. I find myself comparing it to Pascal, which I haven&#8217;t used in decades, but which I enjoyed and remember a little. Python has similarities, which I&#8217;m sure most programming languages do, but its definitely not the same. It feels &#8220;looser&#8221; than Pascal. Lines aren&#8217;t finished with semi-colons. Indentations MEAN something &#8211; they determine what level code is on when nested. Its fun to engage my brain with this, after so long without it.</p>\n<p>Here are links to the resources above:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://automatetheboringstuff.com/\">Automate the Boring Stuff with Python <strong>website</strong></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593275994/\"><strong>Amazon</strong>: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0-84-yl1fUnRuXGFe_F7qSH1LEnn9LkW\"><strong>YouTube</strong>: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (15 videos)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/automate/\"><strong>Udemy</strong>: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming</a></li>\n</ul>\n","excerpt":"<p>Its been a long time since I&#8217;ve directly touched code.
